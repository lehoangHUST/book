00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,130
Hi everyone welcome to the setup and installation lecture so the objectives for this lecture are to

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,080
install Python of Anaconda.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,970
Download the zip file of notebooks that comes off this course and into open Jupiter and explore the

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,410
notebooks and make sure everything is working for you.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,150
So just right off the bat what is anaconda anaconda.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,570
Is a distribution of Python when we say distribution.

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,770
That means it's actually not just including python but it's also including lots of libraries and tools

8
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,240
that we use in this course.

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,460
And it also includes its own virtual environments system which we talk about later on in this course.

10
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,690
It's essentially an all in one install that's extremely popular in data science and machine learning.

11
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,060
So if you ever take any other training and data science and machine learning such as a corporate training

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,850
it's highly likely that they'll also ask you to install Anaconda.

13
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,130
So it's extremely popular in data science and machine learning which is why we're using it in this course

14
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,550
so once we install Anaconda and get Python up and running it's actually going to come with a development

15
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,410
environment called Jupiter.

16
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:11,090
And Jupiter is a developed environment where we can write normal Python code but what's really cool

17
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:16,730
about it is it also allows us to display images and then write down markdown notes all within the same

18
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,510
notebook.

19
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,460
So it's a really great learning tool and it's a great teaching tool as well which is why you use it

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,780
throughout this course.

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,910
And it's also one of the most popular developed environments in data science for exploring and analyzing

22
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,560
data.

23
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,160
And as you learn more and more about the course and the libraries then you'll see why it's such a popular

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,920
tool because you get to see everything on a single screen you could see the images your data the sheets

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,440
et cetera all in one window.

26
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,190
Now I want to make it clear if you're an experienced Python user and maybe you've tried Jupiter but

27
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,120
really didn't like it.

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,700
You have your own setup like Sublime Text or PI charm or any other sort of environment.

29
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,270
Please feel free to use any development environment you prefer.

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,600
Sometimes some students just don't like Jupiter and they like their own thing.

31
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,690
That's totally fine.

32
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,280
We're not forcing it to use Jupiter.

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,610
The python code we're gonna show throughout the course works in any environment.

34
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,610
I just want to be clear.

35
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,030
Please choose any development environment you prefer.

36
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,250
But if you're totally new to this I would highly recommend you go off the Anaconda and Jupiter setup

37
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,780
we show here that we can follow along this course.

38
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,050
And I hope you learn to love it as much as I do OK so let's get started.

39
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,500
We're gonna download Anaconda.

40
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,460
Go ahead and go to w w w the anaconda dot com.

41
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,150
Or just simply google search Anaconda Python download and we should end up at the same page.

42
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,770
I want to go ahead and jump in a comment dot com in my browser now.

43
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:35,740
All right here I am.

44
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,390
Anaconda dot com.

45
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,140
Keep in mind Anaconda dot com.

46
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,770
This page actually updates itself quite frequently.

47
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,450
So the style may change and you may see different things for example right now.

48
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,710
They're going to have an anaconda con so the style that page looks a little different and the buttons

49
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,970
may be or the overall look at the page may be different for you when you actually visit this.

50
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:01,600
But essentially we're looking for is the download section and you'll see some products here why Anaconda

51
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,360
but somewhere on this page you should see download.

52
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,530
And if you're having trouble finding that you can just go ahead and google search and call download.

53
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,910
And it should eventually take you to this page.

54
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:18,350
So what we see here is the download for Python 3 and Python to this course uses the latest version of

55
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,390
Python 3.

56
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,100
So we'll go ahead and use that for our Installer.

57
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,050
The one thing you need to make sure is that you select the correct installer for your operating system.

58
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:32,780
So right now I want a Windows computer so I will choose the windows installer for Anaconda.

59
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,680
Now if you're on Mac OS go ahead and choose the Mac OS installer for Linux.

60
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,690
Go ahead and choose the Linux installer something you should know about is for a Mac OS.

61
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,230
There's a graphical installer and then a command line installer.

62
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,790
The graphical installer is a lot easier to use because it has a little window that pops up and show

63
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,260
tells you what to do as you go along.

64
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,810
So I would recommend the graphical installer.

65
00:03:54,050 --> 00:04:00,440
So I'll go ahead and tell on a Windows computer download the windows installer for the python 3 version.

66
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,100
If you're watching this at some point in the future in Python three point eight has come out that's

67
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,380
totally ok to basically just be using Python 3.

68
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:08,810
All right.

69
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:14,440
Once it's finished downloading we'll go ahead and open up this executable file if you're on Mac OS.

70
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,820
It's going to probably be some TMG file or something that essentially walks you through the graphical

71
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,660
installer.

72
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:25,400
So we're going to open that up and then you should see essentially the setup wizard jump out for you.

73
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,910
So we'll go ahead and click next here and then there's the license agreement.

74
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,750
Go ahead and agree to it.

75
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,810
And then there's the install for just me and all users.

76
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,940
If you're on a work computer you probably don't have adamant privileges.

77
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,320
So just go ahead and install it for just me.

78
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,430
Essentially that means you have to log into your user account and it'll only work for this particular

79
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,000
user account.

80
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,770
So go ahead and click Next go ahead and choose the default location for the destination folder and then

81
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:56,200
if you're on a Windows computer you'll see this option for advanced installation options and you should

82
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,720
actually check both of these boxes.

83
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,210
One of them says that it's actually not recommended of adding Anaconda to your path environment variable.

84
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,860
The reason they say that's not recommended is because if you have different versions of python that

85
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,770
may mess around and make Anaconda the essentially default version of Python in your computer and also

86
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:20,500
the default way of running certain actions at your command line actually do recommend that especially

87
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,520
if your already have a pretty big installation of Python.

88
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,330
Now if you're an advanced user and you understand what it means to set a path enviroment variable I'll

89
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,530
leave it up to you whether or not you want to add Anaconda to your path.

90
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,620
However if you're brand new and you don't know what adding something to your path environment variable

91
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,810
means then definitely go ahead and select this even if it says not recommended.

92
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,660
Go ahead and check both boxes.

93
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,000
That's going to allow me to create virtual environments at the command line which is very useful.

94
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,190
So then once you've done that go ahead and select install.

95
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:50,850
All right.

96
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,900
Now that that has finished installing we should be able to search for the anaconda Navigator on our

97
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,770
computer.

98
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,510
If you been searching for Anaconda on your computer you should see a couple of options show up.

99
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,480
One is the anaconda prompt and the other is the anaconda navigator.

100
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:12,590
Go ahead and click open the anaconda navigator upon the anaconda navigator opening you should see a

101
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:18,480
bunch of applications show up and essentially this is a really convenient way of opening up your develop

102
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:23,510
environments and you'll notice that Anaconda actually comes of several development environments already

103
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,340
included.

104
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,800
It comes with Jupiter lamb Jupiter notebook spider Kuti console and more.

105
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,380
The one we're going to be using in this course is the Jupiter notebook.

106
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,880
Keep in mind there's a Jupiter lamp which looks really similar but we'll actually using a Jupiter notebook

107
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,530
and as I keep mentioning you're free to use any development environment you choose but we'll be using

108
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,470
Jupiter notebook.

109
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,590
So what we want to do is go ahead and launch Jupiter notebook so click here where it says launch and

110
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,490
then what's going to happen is you should see a browser window pop up.

111
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,450
And here we can see that Jupiter notebook has automatically opened up in your browser.

112
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:04,020
Now if you don't have Google Chrome as your default browser I would highly recommend you do use it because

113
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,860
that is usually what works best with Jupiter.

114
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,190
Don't use an older browser like Internet Explorer Microsoft Edge should be fine.

115
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,240
But Internet Explorer it's actually not even supported by Microsoft anymore.

116
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,990
So I would highly recommend using Google Chrome for the Jupiter.

117
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,010
You can also use things like Firefox Mozilla those should technically all work fine as well.

118
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,120
OK.

119
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,710
So you notice that Jupiter opens in your browser something I want to clarify is that you do not need

120
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,560
to be connected to the Internet in order for Jupiter to work.

121
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,620
It's merely using your browser as a graphical interface window.

122
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,930
It's not actually connecting to the Internet here.

123
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:42,090
So you'll notice that I basically see all the folders that are on my computer.

124
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,300
I can see my desktop folders my documents and my downloads.

125
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:51,570
So what I want to do is download the zip file of notebooks that comes along for this course and then

126
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,400
access them through Jupiter.

127
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,900
So let's go ahead and download that zip file.

128
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,800
OK so if you go to the actual course content page you'll see the curriculum laid out and you should

129
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,800
notice under section one course Introduction in the third lecture course if it cuz there's a zip file

130
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,420
here that you can download.

131
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:15,000
And as you were reading that lecture you should have seen a little resource article points out that

132
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,130
there's a resource there to download.

133
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,010
Now keep in mind if you're viewing a lecture video.

134
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:25,700
So for example here I'm viewing essentially our intro environments set up an installation lecture if

135
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,610
click over here on the top left.

136
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,760
It should also be an indication that resources can be downloaded and you can then see the course content

137
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,310
and click on this zip file and it will download the zip file.

138
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,060
So go ahead and download the zip file either from course f excuse and I've places zip file in a couple

139
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,320
of other lectures in case you missed it including this one and the Jupiter note lecture.

140
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,870
It's the same zip file it's just there for free to download.

141
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,310
And go ahead and download it and remember where you downloaded it and then unzip that file.

142
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,330
So right now my version is underneath my downloads folder so I'm going to go unzip it.

143
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:57,900
All right.

144
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,560
So underneath my downloads folder I'll go ahead and unzip this.

145
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,020
You should be able to see extract all or you can download a program program like when RA or seven zip.

146
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,000
Go ahead and do that really just any way whatever the typical method used for ends up being folders.

147
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,070
Go ahead and do that Windows and Mac OS have a default.

148
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,230
So go ahead or just extract everything and unzip it.

149
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,490
So let that unzip and then once that's unzip you should see a folder here and you'll see something that

150
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,240
says refactor.

151
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,910
Go ahead and click on that and you'll see all the course notes organized in order that they are in the

152
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,500
course.

153
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:38,000
And if you then double click on these you'll see a bunch of files called I.P. y and be files.

154
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,170
Now the thing about these files if you're to try to double click on them and open them directly.

155
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,590
That wouldn't work actually to be opened directly through the Jupiter notebook system.

156
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,650
So now that we know that our unzip folder is underneath downloads we're gonna go back to our browser

157
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,110
where we have the Jupiter notebook and open the files that way.

158
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,020
So let me go ahead and jump back to that.

159
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,730
So here I am back at Jupiter notebook.

160
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:07,080
Go ahead and find your Downloads folder and then find the folder Pi the SNL bootcamp master go to the

161
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,410
refactor and then you'll see all the files here and the first ones we're gonna go be going over there

162
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,580
all in order is Python crash course and then these notebooks you simply click on them and then once

163
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,500
they're done loading you can see all the information here.

164
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,020
And later on we'll talk more details about how you can actually run the Jupiter notebooks.

165
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:31,080
Keep in mind that previously when I was filming this course we didn't have it organized in a numerical

166
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,350
fashion like this.

167
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:38,520
We just had it organized by general topic but now we've reorganized and refactor the actual notebooks

168
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,280
and folders so that it's a lot clearer.

169
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,620
You do one first then two then three and four then five and so on.

170
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,760
OK.

171
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,770
So that's basically it for our setup.

172
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:52,360
You should now be able to run Jupiter notebook and you should have installed Anaconda and then downloaded

173
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,060
the notes and follow along.

174
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,070
Please keep in mind that if you're ever getting an error with trying to follow along with a video try

175
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,480
running our notebooks first specifically our solutions notebook for the exercise.

176
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,830
A lot of times easy to make a simple typo which is why we provide the notebooks that go along with each

177
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,100
video lecture to help you out with any problems of that type.

178
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,910
Okay.

179
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,890
Thanks everyone and we'll see you at the next lecture.
