00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,870
Hello everyone and welcome to the plotless and cufflinks lecture and this lecture we're going to learn

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,890
a bit of the background behind plotline cufflinks which allow us to create interactive visualizations

3
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:23,730
quietly is an interactive visualization library that's open source and cufflinks connects this library

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,750
with pandas.

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,490
And that way we're going to be able to create interactive visualizations directly off our data frame

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,100
.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:35,480
However before we actually explore these libraries we're going to need to install them.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,100
You'll need to use Pipp to install these libraries either at your command line or at your terminal and

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,720
you can write Pitman's style plot Lee and Pipp install cufflinks.

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,750
This should still work even if you're using the Anaconda's distribution.

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:53,700
These two libraries just aren't available on the Konda install at this time so go ahead and use pipin

12
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,650
style plotless and Pippin's cufflinks at your command line terminal in order to get these libraries

13
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,300
.

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,170
Now let's go ahead and get a quick tour of the official Web site before the next lecture we actually

15
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,990
show you how to use these libraries.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,110
I'm going to go ahead and jump to platies official Web site now.

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:09,920
All right.

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,750
Here I am at the plotless Web site.

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,380
It set P L O T L Y and you can check out the Web site.

20
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:22,320
There's a lot of information on it in a quick note plotless is also a company but they make money by

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,590
hosting your visualizations and hosting your dashboards.

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,900
If you want to keep everything local or host it yourself the library that operates on all these features

23
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,690
is open source and free.

24
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:37,480
So don't worry you won't have to pay something to use politely and politely.

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,120
It's compatible with a variety of tools such as our Matlab excel and Javascript.

26
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,830
But we're going to focus on using it with Python.

27
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,440
If you go ahead and click on this python link you'll get a link to a getting started page with Python

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,750
.

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,080
It will show you how to get started in.

30
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,500
Interestingly they'll have a link to Pandas and that's what we're going to be focusing on using plotless

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,520
with pandas and in order to you we use plotless of pandas.

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,940
You need to install plotline as said here in the instructions you're also later on going to have to

33
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,130
install cufflinks.

34
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:08,820
Cufflinks.

35
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,390
Is the library that connects plot Lee with pandas.

36
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:19,010
And I'm going to go ahead and go to the web page for cufflinks.

37
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,230
And this is the get her page for cufflinks and cufflinks basically.

38
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:28,170
It's a productivity tool that allows you to quickly call plot's just as you would with pandas for instance

39
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:34,120
a data frame dot plot method that is set you'll actually create an interactive visualization using plot

40
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,740
Lee in a quick disclaimer.

41
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,910
I'm actually a contributor to this library myself and you can actually see my merged branch right here

42
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,320
at Jey imports here.

43
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,750
But anyways there's pretty nice tutorials here under cufflinks and we're going to go through some of

44
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,030
these topics and show you how to actually use cufflinks effectively in order to create really nice looking

45
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,980
interactive his lazy actions.

46
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:02,190
And here's just an example of one U.K. swap rates and you can see that this is a 3D surface and this

47
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,300
is done directly off of a data frame.

48
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:11,120
There's some release notes here and then there's some links that documentation up above over here.

49
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:11,760
All right.

50
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,740
Let's go ahead and just get started in the next lecture we're actually going to show you how to code

51
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,220
interactive visualizations using these libraries.

52
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,080
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
