00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,040
Hello everyone and welcome to the Python for data science and machine learning boot camp.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,310
My name is Jose Portsea and I'll be your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,260
I've taught tens of thousands of students on to me about Python and data science and I'm so excited

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,290
to teach you about all these topics in my brand new course data scientist has been ranked the number

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,140
one job by glass door and is an excellent career path providing not just great salary potential but

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,720
the opportunity to work on some of the world's most interesting problems.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,600
And this course will be covering the most popular Python data science libraries including numb pie site

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,550
pie pandas seaborne sikat learn map plot lib plot Lee pie spark for big data deep learning libraries

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,840
and much more.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,920
Don't worry if you don't know all these library names yet by the end of the Course you'll feel very

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,790
comfortable putting these technologies on your resume.

12
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,830
Let's go ahead and take a quick look inside the course to see all the contents.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,350
We'll start off of a crash course in Python.

14
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,400
This course is designed for students of some program experience.

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,840
You'll make sure to refresh your memory on important syntax and topics before we get started with the

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,050
data analysis material of the course.

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,410
Then we'll switch gears and start learning about pi.

18
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:14,040
A scientific computing library for Python that's going to allow us to work with data arrays in Python

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,330
.

20
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,050
Then we'll continue our understanding by learning about pandas.

21
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,650
The fantastic data analysis library allows us to read them manipulate data from multiple sources including

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,730
CAC files Excel workbooks H-2 mail web pages for web scraping sequel databases and much more all along

23
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,100
the way.

24
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,190
Have exercise notebooks or practice your new skills you'll be given real world data sets and questions

25
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,570
to answer about them.

26
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,310
After every exercise we also have a full solution walkthrough of the exercise questions.

27
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,960
Then we'll begin discussing basic data visualization.

28
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,130
By learning about the map plot lib library.

29
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,250
Then later on we'll create beautiful statistical plots for the Seaborn library will also cover interactive

30
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,330
plotting techniques so you can share your work in a way that's interactive for your users.

31
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:05,730
Also cover how to interactively plot financial information will even cover geographical plotting techniques

32
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,180
.

33
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,670
After that we'll reach a second half of the course where we all use sikat learn in Python to implement

34
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:16,440
machine learning algorithms including topics such as linear regression logistic regression several classification

35
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,440
techniques such as decision trees and random force unsupervised clustering algorithms.

36
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,140
Natural Language Processing and much much more.

37
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,500
After all of that you'll begin to learn how to work with big data using the latest SPARC technologies

38
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,610
.

39
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,820
I found on Amazon Web Services will even cover the basics of using the newest deep learning libraries

40
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,930
.

41
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,570
Every single section ends for full exercise and a solution walkthrough of the exercise questions Bielsa

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,120
capstone projects and over a dozen fully implemented machine learning portfolio projects.

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,900
This force consists of over 100 HD video lectures with fully written out code notebooks for reference

44
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,910
so you can learn in whatever way works best for you.
