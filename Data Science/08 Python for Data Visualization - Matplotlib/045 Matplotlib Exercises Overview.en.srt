Hello everyone and welcome to the mat plotless exercises overview lecture this lecture we're going to

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,490
quickly get an overview of the exercises for the map plot lib lecture.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,470
Let's go ahead and jump to the Jupiter note book called Map exercises.

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,820
This notebook is located under the Python for data visualization folder under the map plotless folder

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,390
.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,470
I'm going to go ahead and go to the notebook now.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,950
OK here I am at the notebook for platelet exercises.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,100
This is just going to be a simple task for reviewing some that play live.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,890
Take your time with the sense that live can be tricky to understand at first if you're a true beginner

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,970
in it.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,650
These are relatively simple plots but just take your time and a quick note all the commands for plotting

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,320
a figure should all go in the same cell.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,240
Separating the commands line by line into multiple cells may cause nothing to show up.

14
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:01,510
So if he's in Jupiter note book each exercises cell coach all go into one cell.

15
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,110
Throughout these exercises you're going to be using the data defined in the cell right here X Y and

16
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,830
Z and there's basically just four exercises or exercise one.

17
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,690
We are going to be trying to recreate this figure right here a simple one that exercise too.

18
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:24,600
You'll be working with an insert set into the axis here and then plotting on it and then exercise three

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,880
you're going to do a similar task.

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,620
Notice here we're plotting x versus Z in X versus Y and then here we're also doing another subplot exercise

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,170
.

22
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,590
OK that's it for this little lecture here.

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,800
Go ahead and get started.

24
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,460
And in the next lecture we're going to go ahead and go through the solutions.

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,370
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
