00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,870
Hello everyone and welcome to the first map plot lib lecture and this lecture we're going to begin to

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,260
show you how you can use map plot lived with Python.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,360
Let's go ahead and jump to the Jupiter note book to get started.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:16,890
All right.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,120
Here I am at the notebook the notebook for this lecture is called Math lib concepts lecture and all

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,390
the code are going to be doing is located in this notebook as well as a lot more information that's

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,690
available to you regarding that plot lib.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,450
OK.

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,680
I'm going to go ahead and jump to a blank notebook and walk through all this code and explain it for

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,300
you.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,920
Let me go out and click this new tab and here we have this new notebook.

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,530
When you go ahead and hide the header and toolbar just get a little more room here.

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:44,920
OK.

14
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,990
Let's go to get started about plotless.

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,870
Once you've installed met.

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:58,200
The first thing you're going to be able to do is say import map plot lib pie plots as TLT and then if

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:05,710
you're using the Jupiter note book what you're going to do is say percent sign Matt plot lib space in

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,680
line and that's going to allow you to actually see the plots you create inside the Jupiter notebook

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,110
.

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,750
Go ahead and run this great.

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,920
If you are not using that Jupiter notebook's system what you going to go ahead and do is at the end

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,770
of all your commands for plotting which will show later what you will type is Hilti that show close

23
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,100
parentheses and later on and we actually start plotting some examples.

24
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,280
Asha you would actually put that into your code.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,850
All right.

26
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,830
Let's go ahead and walk through the very simple example using two numpy race going to go in and say

27
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:46,040
import them PI and P and say x is equal to any Lynn space.

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:55,020
So it's going to be linearly spaced we'll go from 0 to 5 and grab 11 points and then y is going to be

29
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,210
equal to x.

30
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,110
So the power of two.

31
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,550
So if we take a look at x and y we have an array from 0 to 5 and then WHY are just all those elements

32
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,260
squared.

33
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,200
Now basic map plot Lim commands allow you to very quickly create a plot and we'll show you two ways

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,850
of creating map plotted plots.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,550
One is a functional method and the other one is the object oriented method will show the functional

36
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,070
method first and then we'll shift over to the object oriented method.

37
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,770
Since that's usually the better way of creating a about Cutlip plot let's go and show you the functional

38
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,040
method first the functional method is actually quite simple.

39
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:40,290
You say peel t got plots and then we can do shift tab here and you're going to pass in several arguments

40
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:40,720
.

41
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:47,130
First one you're going to do for just a basic plot is passing your X and your y elements and then we

42
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,370
can go ahead and do shift enter.

43
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,000
And here this will actually show the plot.

44
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,870
We've went ahead and plotted X versus Y.

45
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,470
If you're not in the Jupiter note book which you are going to do at the end of this line if you're in

46
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,770
your code say peel t show and then if I run that we can see we get the same plot.

47
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,880
You don't have to use t show unless you're using something that's not that Jupiter note no but the difference

48
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,170
in the Jupiter notebook is essentially like you're printing the plot.

49
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,040
Notice here if I don't have PBT that show I get out.

50
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:25,820
So if I remove this or actually put it back in then I don't get the out.

51
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:34,560
So that's essentially the same thing just to do a quick analogy as typing a string versus saying print

52
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,040
the string

53
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,040
and that's the exact same thing.

54
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,760
What KEELTY That shows doing is essentially printing out this plot instead of just showing the plot

55
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,280
.

56
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,290
All right.

57
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,510
For now on we won't actually concern ourselves with concert's consistently typing appeal to that show

58
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:51,780
.

59
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,690
However if you're not using Jupiter note book you will have to keep typing that.

60
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,370
So just keep that in mind.

61
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,460
All right.

62
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:02,120
So that's the most basic way to plot something about polyp which isn't so bad.

63
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:09,270
You can actually add that plot Matlab like arguments such as color and lifestyle.

64
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,810
And that will allow you to continue to edit this plot.

65
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,730
We'll talk a lot more about this later on as far as line styles and color styles but if you're familiar

66
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,850
with Matlab this probably already seems familiar to you.

67
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,670
Let's go to remove that for now and just go for the basics.

68
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,330
If we want to add an X label y label or title to this plot we can do that with the following methods

69
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:30,510
.

70
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:39,240
Can Say T X label and then just passing a string you want for the X label or go out and say X label

71
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:48,750
and then for the y label you can say p t y label pass in a string why label them for the title you can

72
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:54,240
say Piazzi that title and then we'll just go ahead and put in the title string there.

73
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,810
Go ahead and run this.

74
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,290
And now we can see we have an X label a y label and a title.

75
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:05,830
And later on we're going to learn how we can specify the CPI or dots per inch in order to get some more

76
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,370
clarity here such as a finer font.

77
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,890
Let's go ahead and continue on with creating multi plots on the same canvas.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,280
We're going to go ahead and scroll down here.

79
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:23,320
Remove the cell and talk about putting multi plots on the same canvas nerds to do that.

80
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:29,740
We're going to say peel t subplot and subplot takes in couple of arguments as well.

81
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,920
Right now we can't see them so I'll go and tell you the first one is going to be the number of rows

82
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,410
.

83
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,300
The number of columns and then the plot number you're referring to in this case we'll just go ahead

84
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,970
and say one and we'll go ahead and plot something on that cell.

85
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:56,230
Will say X Y and we'll go ahead and specify that it's the color red string are as a third arguments

86
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:56,940
begin.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,480
Don't worry too much about fully understanding this because once we get to the object oriented method

88
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,480
a lot of this going to make way more sense.

89
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,160
But I just want to show you what's possible for now.

90
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,940
Well let's go ahead and say another appeal to that subplot we specify one row by two columns.

91
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,110
And the third argument is the plot number.

92
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:20,270
Now we're going to edit the second plot and we'll say peel t that plot.

93
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:27,100
Well go ahead and do Y versus x and specify B for blue as a string.

94
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,760
Here let's go ahead and run this and see what we get.

95
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:38,050
OK so now we have two subplots here that's creating multiple plots on the same canvas.

96
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,640
Now we're going to do is after we've seen the very basics of creating a plot we're going to break this

97
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:48,170
all down for a more formal introduction to that libs object oriented API method.

98
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,990
And this means we're going to instantiate figure objects and then call methods or attributes from that

99
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,710
object.

100
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,590
And that's going to be a much better way of actually using that plot live.

101
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,360
So the basics for now are just using PBT the plot and then putting in your data or GLT that subplot

102
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,760
specifying the number of rows and columns and then the figure we are working on and then using Kilty

103
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,610
that plot.

104
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,940
Let's go and switch gears to the object oriented method and this is going to be much better.

105
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,500
The main idea in using the more formal object oriented method is to create figure objects and then just

106
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,570
call methods off of this.

107
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,480
Let me go in and show you what I mean by that.

108
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:31,860
I'm going to go ahead and say fig is equal to peel t figure and I'm going to go in and close the princes

109
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,300
there.

110
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,960
Now if I just run that cell.

111
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,420
Notice I have a figure object has been created this figure object you can think of it as just kind of

112
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,580
this imaginary blank canvas.

113
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,810
And we can add a set of access to this campus.

114
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:55,150
So in the same cell I'm going to say XS is equal to Fig dot add underscore axes and I'm going to add

115
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,270
a set of axes.

116
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:03,370
And the way you can add a set of axes is by passing in a list and the list takes int for arguments a

117
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,930
left bottom width and height arguments that range from 0 to 1.

118
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,930
Basically the percent of that blank canvas you want to go ahead and take.

119
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,670
Let me go in and show an example.

120
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,120
And again I'm kind of going to be showing you a lot of stuff that won't make sense at first but everything

121
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,840
will make sense at the end as you see repeated examples and you break it down further.

122
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,100
So I'm just typing in some numbers here.

123
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,090
This is going to be left of the axes.

124
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,310
It's going to be the bottom of the axes.

125
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,230
And this is going to be the width and the height of the axes 0.8.

126
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,170
Let me go ahead and run this on the cell.

127
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,320
And now notice what I get here.

128
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,920
Now I have a blank set of axes.

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,310
So I said P-T that figure created a figure object and then off that figure object I called the method

130
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:54,880
add a set of axes and passed in a list of where I actually want the axes to be placed next what I'm

131
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,800
going to do is actually plot on that set of axes.

132
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,290
And this is going to feel familiar to what we just did earlier.

133
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,900
You're going to say axes stop plots and let's go ahead and plot x and y on that set of axes and then

134
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,160
do shift enter.

135
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,440
And now you can see we've basically come up with the same plot we did earlier except using an object

136
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,460
oriented method.

137
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:21,510
So if I scroll back up here this is the plot we did earlier we just said Appeal teed that plot but now

138
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:26,040
using this sort of object oriented method we're going to have a lot more control over this.

139
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,970
It's a little more involved as far as the steps we need to take.

140
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,650
But it's definitely worth it.

141
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,920
So we've created the figure we called the figure method.

142
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:41,030
Add axes on this pass then a list of axes and then plotted on that sort of axes if we want to continue

143
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,580
by putting x labels y labels and titles.

144
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,850
You can go ahead and do that on that set of axes.

145
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,070
You can say set underscore ex-slave.

146
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,360
It's a little different from the peel T which is just X label.

147
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,770
When you're working at this Xs object you're going to say sets underscore.

148
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:02,920
And now we can go ahead and pass in the string x label and you're going to do the same thing for y labels

149
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,990
lips y label.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,760
And let's go ahead and do the same thing for a title set underscore title

151
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:21,060
now if we run this we should see our new labels X label y label and set title.

152
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:28,960
Let's go ahead and continue this idea of object oriented programming with that live by putting in two

153
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,700
sets of figures on one canvas.

154
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,350
And this will start to make sense as far as what this list is referencing.

155
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,180
I'm going to go ahead and scroll down to a new cell and zoom in a little bit just so we can get a very

156
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,730
clear picture of what we're actually doing here.

157
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:48,640
I'm going to say fig is equal to realty figure.

158
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,800
So I'm creating that figure object.

159
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,230
So there's my figure object.

160
00:10:53,280 --> 00:11:02,640
I'm going to say axes one is equal to Fig dot axes.

161
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:11,380
I don't mean to go hand in set main axes it will be zero point one zero point one and then zero point

162
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,840
eight 0.8.

163
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,430
And again this is the left the bottom and then the width and height of that sort of axes.

164
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:28,710
And then I'm going to add another set of axes column axes two going to say fig and underscore axes.

165
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,140
And then when I'm going to go ahead and do is basically put inserts axes I'm going to say the bottom

166
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:41,180
of the set of axes starts 20 percent from the left 50 percent from the bottom.

167
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,240
So excuse me here I'm talking about basically this.

168
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,790
This bottom corner of the axes sluffed and the bottom.

169
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,450
So 20 percent in from the left 50 percent up from the bottom.

170
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:57,310
And then we will say it takes up 40 percent of the canvas size and width and 30 percent of the canvas

171
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,310
size and height.

172
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,690
So all these values here must be between 0 and 1.

173
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,180
Let's go ahead and run this and know what we get out.

174
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:12,400
We get out this basically insert set of axes and hopefully now you can begin to see what these values

175
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:18,190
actually correspond to what I want you to do now is go ahead and pause the video and play around with

176
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,900
these numbers.

177
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:24,540
Make sure they're all either between 0 and 1 and see how they correlate with this set of axes.

178
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,200
Go ahead and just play around with axes 2 and move it around.

179
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,940
For instance try to get this sort of axes to over here at this bottom corner.

180
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,050
Good impulsivity.

181
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,920
See if you can move this insur over to the bottom corner.

182
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,280
All right.

183
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,130
I'm going to see if I can do that now.

184
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:48,130
So if I want this at the bottom corner I probably want to say that it goes left bottom width and height

185
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,640
.

186
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:53,790
So I will try shifting it down by making this basically just 0 so start.

187
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,910
Well it's going to say 0.1 here start at zero 1 5.

188
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:05,270
So a little off the bottom of this insert here of Axis 1 will go ahead and run this.

189
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,300
And there I was able to move it more towards the bottom remember this second one is the bottom.

190
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,350
And now we want to move more towards the right which means from the left a one or two percent.

191
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,530
Wise move this bottom corner more over from the left.

192
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,310
Let's go to set this as 8.

193
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,640
And that looks like shifted it a little too much.

194
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:32,550
So let's go in and shift it back to maybe five and there we can see we have it now in the bottom.

195
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,460
All right go ahead and play around if that.

196
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,170
If these figures are these numbers are still a little unclear.

197
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,370
Remember they're basically just denoting the left bottom and the width and height from range 0 to 1

198
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,210
relation to the blank canvas.

199
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:55,280
We're going to go ahead and reset these to what we have in that originally 0.2 and 0.5.

200
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,410
So we have our little insert there.

201
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,880
And then what I'm going to do is go ahead and plot on these axes.

202
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:12,310
So I'm going to say axes one plots and I will say X come a Y and then I will say axes two plots will

203
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:16,510
go and say why come x Let's go and run this.

204
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:24,030
And here I can see now I have my little insur and my outer plot and then I can keep adding stuff on

205
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,480
each set of axes if I want my insert to have a title for instance that's axes to.

206
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:38,500
I can say axes to the set title and we'll go and say insert.

207
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:44,870
Well it's going to make it very clear we'll say smaller lots and then on axes 1.

208
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,470
Let's go ahead and set a title

209
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:54,550
and we will set this title as larger clots going and run that.

210
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,100
So notice what happened here.

211
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:02,290
I actually got an error because I didn't actually see smaller plot because I forgot to put a 2.

212
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,960
Here let's run this one more time.

213
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,250
OK now we are getting what we're supposed to get.

214
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,610
We have larger plot and smaller plot.

215
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:15,860
And basically that's the idea behind object oriented programming that Portland you create a figure.

216
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,830
And that's essentially just an empty canvas.

217
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,110
So let me go in and show that one more time just by putting this in a cell by itself.

218
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,650
We create this empty figure there's nothing to show.

219
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:34,900
And then you add a set of axes to it by saying axes whatever one or two etc. equals fig thought at underscore

220
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:40,540
axes and you pass and this list that goes from left bottom and then the width and the height in relation

221
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,720
to this empty canvas.

222
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,920
So if we run this then we have our empty set of axes and then you can plot off those axes you can say

223
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:53,060
axes one plot and then X come a Y.

224
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:53,940
All right.

225
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,590
This is the sort of methodology we're going to be working with for a map Cutlip as far as the very basic

226
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,750
way of working that plotless which is the functional method.

227
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,890
You can just say appeal to that plot or peel that subplot.

228
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,410
We're going to learn how to create subplots using this object oriented method which is going to be a

229
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,190
lot more efficient and grant us a lot more control.

230
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,700
OK.

231
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,250
Go ahead and review this section of the map plot lib concepts lecture no book.

232
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:25,450
There's a lot more notes and a lot more comments in the note book in case any of this confused you but

233
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,210
hopefully by now you have a full understanding of basically this.

234
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:34,420
These lines of code right here if you understand what's going on in the cell then you're pretty much

235
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,340
good to go.

236
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,900
We just create a figure.

237
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:43,150
We add an axes to that figure to find the location of that set of axes with this list and then you can

238
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,140
plot on that sort of axes you can set the titles at the X label y label etc..

239
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,000
All right.

240
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,890
Thanks everyone.

241
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,930
And I will see you at the next lecture or we're going to continue this discussion off of the same Jupiter

242
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,930
notebook.

243
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,430
Thanks and I'll see you next lecture
