00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,890
Now that we've finished learning about our data analysis libraries it's time to actually start visualizing

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,740
that data.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,970
We'll start off by learning about MAP plot live then we'll move on to seaborne for statistical plots

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,220
.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,750
Afterwards we'll learn about pandas built in data visualization capabilities and then we'll see how

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,260
to use plot to create awesome interactive plots with just a few lines of Python code.

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,610
Thank you so much and I'll see you at the next lecture.
