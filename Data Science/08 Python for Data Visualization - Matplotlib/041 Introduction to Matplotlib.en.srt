00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,990
Hello everyone and welcome to the introduction to lib lecture and this lecture we're going to get a

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,560
brief introduction of what Matt it is and then show you just a little bit of the Web site from plotless

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,300
.

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:23,160
Matt lib or as some people pronounce it Matt plus libe is the most popular plodding library for Python

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:29,370
and it really gives you complete control over almost every aspect of a figure or plot and it's designed

6
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,950
to have a very similar feel to Matlab which is another programming language in its own graphical plotting

7
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,650
capabilities map plot lib works very well with Pandanus and umpire race which is why we're going to

8
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,100
learn about it later on.

9
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,420
We're going to learn about some other libraries such as Seaborn that is actually built off of Matt Plup

10
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:46,900
live.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,500
But in order to understand those libraries it's important to understand that plot lived First you'll

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,450
need to install it with either Pipp or Konda at your command line or terminal with one of the following

13
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,580
commands for using the Anaconda distribution of python.

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,270
A simple Konda install Matt Cutlip at your command line or terminal should install that live for you

15
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:06,660
.

16
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,840
Or if you using another version of Python Pipp install matplotlib should also work for you.

17
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,160
Now let's go ahead and get a quick tour of the official website.

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,440
Ok here I am at that plot live org which is the official Web site for map plot lym you'll see here there's

19
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,220
some introduction information as well as some more official installation instructions and some other

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,890
documentation links.

21
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,850
Probably the most important link on this page however is right here under gallery.

22
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,430
If you click on gallery or go to that part live the org slash gallery you'll get taken to this link

23
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,710
and you should see a list of a bunch of different types of plot names.

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,880
And if you keep scrolling down you'll see that there's a bunch of figures or example figures and these

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,310
are all the various types of plots that Cutlip is capable of creating for you.

26
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,800
Later on we'll learn how to use other libraries that are better for things such as the fiscal plots

27
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:56,910
.

28
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,470
But if you ever find yourself having a question of that plot lives capabilities you can come to this

29
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,580
page and search for the kind of plot you're looking for.

30
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,960
For example if I go ahead and scroll back up here let's say you want to make a pie chart.

31
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,800
Will you come here and there's a gallery look for where it says pie charts.

32
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,640
Click here.

33
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,980
High end polar charts.

34
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,950
They'll come down to this link and then I'll show you some couple of figures here that are hopefully

35
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,360
relevant examples once you find one that looks like what you want to do is go in and click this first

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,240
one.

37
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,420
It will take you to an example page that not only has to figure but also has very well commented code

38
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,800
and instructions on how to perform whatever plots you're looking for.

39
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,170
In this case a pie chart.

40
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:37,790
All right.

41
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,740
So that's probably the most helpful page on that putt.

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,000
The other links are just basically links to the documentation functions in it.

43
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,600
And we're going to go over the most common functions as we continue on throughout this section of the

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,560
course.

45
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,220
All right.

46
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,570
Remember that matplotlib org is a resource for you especially the gallery page.

47
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,950
Coming up next we're going to show you how to actually use Matt Plett live to create your own figures

48
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,500
.

49
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,440
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
