00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello everyone and welcome to Part 3 of the map plot lib lecture series.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,780
In this final part we're going to talk about setting colors line with line types and really customizing

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,380
the options of hire plot actually looks.

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,070
Let's go ahead and jump to the Chippering notebook to get started.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,690
OK here we are at the Jupiter notebook.

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,060
Let's go ahead and talk about setting colors with that plot live.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:39,600
So I'm going to go ahead and just say fig equals VLT figure and then I'm going to go and add a set of

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,720
Access's figure x is equal to Fig.

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:54,140
Add underscore axes and I will set this at 0 0 1 1 and then wups and then off of that sort of axes I

10
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,610
to say X stop plot and do X come a Y.

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,200
And this is a reference to the same x and y that we've been working with.

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,490
So if I go in and plot that I get something that looks like this.

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:12,480
Now I can edit this color of the plot by putting in the color parameter and the color premiÃ¨re can actually

14
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:20,230
take multiple arguments it can take in arguments such as common color strings like blue or let's go

15
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:27,790
and put in orange or you can see when an orange line out or green and you get a green line.

16
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,260
So very basic color names.

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,440
It can actually except as a string if you want to start getting more detailed.

18
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,550
You can actually put in RGV hex codes so I can put in hash tag and then some RG be hex code such as

19
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:45,420
go Gaudens copy this from the notebook f f 8 C 0 0.

20
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,260
Whoops it's.

21
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,600
And that gets you in more custom color.

22
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:58,890
So you can go ahead and google search for RSGB X code maker or Creator and you should have plenty of

23
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,920
tools available freely online.

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,510
We're actually coming up with these are G-B hex codes in case you want to make a very custom color for

25
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,050
very basic colors basically kind of Crayola colors such as purple.

26
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,200
You should be able to easily plot them and just passing the string.

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,660
OK so that's the basics of colors.

28
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,480
Now let's talk about line with and line style if you want to edit the line with.

29
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:31,410
You can actually just pass in line with as an arguments and just put in a number.

30
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:38,230
So for instance if we put in one that is the essentially default line with we want to go double the

31
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,790
default and say line with is equal to 2.

32
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,830
And that will double the width we can continue doing this.

33
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,920
If I want a very thick line just like with equals 20 That's 20 times the thickness of the default line

34
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:50,150
.

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,680
Or if you want a very thin line such as have the default thickness 0.5 you can start getting thinner

36
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,990
and thinner.

37
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:04,650
Another very useful tip as far as line with and line visibility is the alpha arguments so go ahead and

38
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:12,150
set my line equal to line with three and you can specify the alpha argument which allows you to basically

39
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,560
control how transparent the line is.

40
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:21,130
So I can say Alpha is equal to 0.5.

41
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,020
And if I run that now I can see we actually have a little bit more transparency on this line.

42
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:33,050
So you can combine color line with an alpha in order to get the exact appearance that you want.

43
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,880
One last thing to note here is for short hand you actually don't have to type in line with completely

44
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,270
.

45
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,390
You can just type in LW and it will still work just fine.

46
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,580
OK.

47
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,230
So we're talking about line with color and Alpha and I'm going to remove the alpha call.

48
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:56,700
Now let's talk about line style so I can type in line style and line style there's quite a few options

49
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,690
and they're listed in your note book that it basically just defines the style of the line such as a

50
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,270
dashed line or a dotted line.

51
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:10,230
For instance if a person two dashes I end up getting a dashed line and just passing this in as a string

52
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,910
or I pass and a dash and then a period I get the sort of dashed line.

53
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,140
So dash point dash points and then there's a couple of more options pitches.

54
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:26,760
Colon which gets me these smaller dashes here and you can check out the Jupiter note book for this lecture

55
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,350
to see what other options you have.

56
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,140
And then you can do steps hour.

57
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,150
I rarely use those.

58
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:39,440
Most often I'll just either do a dash line or if you just put in one dash it's just a solid line.

59
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,360
OK.

60
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,040
And just like with line with you actually don't need to type in line style.

61
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,850
You just put ls and it will end up working just the same.

62
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:50,890
OK.

63
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,630
So we talked about line with and line style.

64
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,390
Now let's talk about markers.

65
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,380
So markers are going to be used when you have just a few data points.

66
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:06,510
For instance if we take a look at X as a reminder of what it is we can see the x is just an array of

67
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,510
go ahead and check the length x of 11 points.

68
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,940
Let's say actually we wanted to mark were those 11 points occur on this plot.

69
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:25,190
Well I can specify marker as a new arguments should be a comma and then I can pass in a string.

70
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,310
So there's lots of possible marker symbols and they're listed in your note book.

71
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,390
But the most basic one in common one is just this lowercase O as a string.

72
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:41,550
And there you can begin to see some dots that basically mark out each points on X versus Y here and

73
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,110
there's a wide variety of markers available to you.

74
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,260
They're all listed in the note book.

75
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,700
But just to show you a couple who can do things such as plus signs which don't show up too well here

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,760
you can do things such as Little stars like Asterix symbols.

77
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:01,110
You can do things such as passing in these number codes I'm going to make the line with a little thinner

78
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,470
so you can actually see these markers here.

79
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,050
So we wanted to make these markers bigger.

80
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:13,050
Well you may have guessed that marker size isn't arguments so you can go ahead and specify marker size

81
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,010
and essentially just one is the very small size.

82
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,840
And then if you want to make it quite a bit larger you can say 10.

83
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,310
And here we can begin to see these kind of triangles being in the form.

84
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:29,280
So let's go and say just huge markers at 20 and then we can specify markers type ear 2.

85
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:35,790
You can say plus we get these plusses here etc. so all these options are listed in the documentation

86
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,000
.

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,690
And more importantly in your Jupiter note book says there's so many different types of strings you can

88
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,940
pass in as marker for marker codes.

89
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,120
And if you really want to customize your markers for instance go ahead and put this back to lowercase

90
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:54,150
Oh so we get these points here to change this line with back to one.

91
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,410
There's actually quite a few options as far as specifying what the marker looks like.

92
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,690
You can specify the marker face color the marker edge with and the marker edge color.

93
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,520
So first it's going to go out and add these arguments in.

94
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,910
So just press comma enter for a new line.

95
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,390
And I'm going to go out and say Mark face color

96
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,740
and you can specify the marker face color.

97
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,800
So they'll be the color inside of that circle.

98
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,590
Let's go ahead and make it yellow and run this.

99
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,800
And that changed the marker face color.

100
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:32,700
Let's say I want to change the marker edge with I go and edit that as well.

101
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,440
Make that a little thicker such as three that makes a little thicker and let's say actually want to

102
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,750
specify the color of the marker edge.

103
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,640
I can specify a marker edge color.

104
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,650
Now let's go to make that green.

105
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:46,990
All right.

106
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:52,860
So you can see there's a lot of customize ability here and there's a lot of options if you want to see

107
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,520
a bunch of examples of different options you can go ahead and jump to the Jupiter note book for this

108
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,250
lecture.

109
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,460
I to go ahead and do that now.

110
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,290
It's going to go ahead and click on over and if you see here on the map Cutlip concepts lecture.

111
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,380
Right now we're in the section line marker and line and marker styles.

112
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:15,000
Here there's basically a figure where we did told by six on the subplots the first figure size and did

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,830
a bunch of plots and edited the colors the line with the line styles.

114
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,130
And here's a bunch of examples so you can go ahead and read them out.

115
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,020
And if you're looking for a different possible marker symbols are all here as comments or allied cell

116
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,070
types etc..

117
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,690
So there's a lot of different examples here in kind of copy and paste from or build your own knowledge

118
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,100
off of.

119
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,540
Finally let's talk about control over access perience and plot range.

120
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:46,860
And if we hop back over to our original notebook over here we can go ahead and show how we can set the

121
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,410
Y limit and the limit.

122
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,180
We're going to make this just a very simple plot again.

123
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:57,900
Let's go ahead and just make this line with equal to and let's make lifestyle equal some dash line.

124
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,730
OK great.

125
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,650
Let's say I only wanted to show the plot between 0 and 1 on the x axis.

126
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:13,920
Well to do that just clear access and then say set underscore X Lim and then you pass in a list with

127
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,830
a lower bound an upper bound.

128
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,750
So we'll go from 0 to 1.

129
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,720
And here we can see we've set the lower bound an upper bound of the x axis.

130
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,510
Now let's go ahead and do the same thing for the why limit just clear axes and then say sets underscore

131
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:37,380
why Lim and as a list you pass an upper bound and lower bounds lower by that zero comma.

132
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,460
Let's make the upper bound.

133
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,380
So just put it at 2.

134
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,810
Now we can see this plot.

135
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,790
And notice as we zoom in the plot looks more and more like a bunch of straight lines connecting points

136
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:53,020
which makes sense because we don't have as much detail SR's only 11 points as we zoom out.

137
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,030
We see more of a curved line and we can fix that by getting more data points or by zooming out.

138
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:04,590
All right finally I want to hop back over real quick to the map Partlow concepts lecture and talk about

139
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,490
such special plot types.

140
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,280
There's lots and lots of many specialized plot types you can do with MAP plot lib such as bar plots

141
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,520
histograms and scatterplot.

142
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,390
Most of these plot types were actually going to use in another visualization library called Seaborn

143
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,960
which is much better suited for these sort of statistical plotting methods.

144
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,790
But just to show you that you can do this in my live.

145
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:31,400
You can perform scatterplot such as this you can perform histograms using that plot live or even the

146
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,120
things such as box plots.

147
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,760
And here are some examples for you.

148
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,260
Now at the very bottom of your Jupiter notebook for this lecture you'll see a bunch of links for further

149
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,960
reading including the project web page that plotted and one link.

150
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,440
I really like is all the way here second to the bottom.

151
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,590
This Lorieau are a really nice link.

152
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,740
It's a map lib tutorial.

153
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,170
Hopefully you actually know quite a bit now by watching these three lectures that we just did.

154
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,710
But what I really like about this link is that it's essentially just a reference code.

155
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,910
So if you want to change colors in line with you can go in and check out this link.

156
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,040
Just look at the figures and it will tell you how to set ticks at tick labels etc..

157
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,180
Moving spines adding legends.

158
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,620
A lot of these points are actually in the other note book for this lecture series called The advance

159
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,010

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,680
We're not actually going to have a video lecture on those advanced topics for now because we're not

161
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,390
going to use them too often throughout the course.

162
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,650
In fact we're mostly going to be using Seaborn throughout the course.

163
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,440
OK.

164
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,260
Coming up next is a quick overview of the plot plotless exercise and then you'll have a overview of

165
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,150
the solutions for that exercise.

166
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,520
For now go ahead and hold off on these special plot types and wait till we learn about using Seaborn

167
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,400
which is going to be much better equipped for these sort of beautiful statistical plots.

168
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,110
Okay.

169
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,610
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
