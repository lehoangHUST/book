00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,920
Hello everyone and welcome to the regression plot's lecture for seaborne Seaborn has many built in capabilities

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,260
for aggression and plots.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,320
However we won't really discuss regression until the machine learning section of this course.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,590
So for now will only cover the L and plot function L.M. plot allows you to display linear models with

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,560
Seaborn.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,090
Also learn how to size and change the aspect ratio for seaborne plots.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,960
Let's go ahead and jump to Jupiter notebook to get started.

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,980
All right here I am at the Jupiter notebook.

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,550
I want to head an imported seaborne called Matt plotless in line and I have loaded up the tips data

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,410
set that we've been working with.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,020
Go and show you how to use L-M plot to make a very simple linear model plot you just call Esson this

12
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:56,850
L.M. plots and then what feature you want on the x axis versus the y axis going in plot total bill and

13
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:04,980
on the y axis will go ahead and call it in our datasource will be tips.

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,290
Now if you go ahead and run that we see we basically have a scatterplot with a linear fit on top of

15
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:17,340
it and you can actually specify hewe as well if you want some separation based off a categorical feature

16
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:17,790
.

17
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,400
For instance we can specify Huie to sex.

18
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,340
And now you have essentially two scatter plots and two linear fits on top of this and this basically

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,870
is far something to infer out of this plot is that male and female essentially have the same linear

20
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,190
fit as far as total bill vs tip.

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,340
Something to note here is they can actually begin to pass in that plot live style parameters such as

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,900
you want it to affect the markers or marker types here.

23
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:53,400
You could begin to say something like this will go in and say markers is equal to.

24
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,080
As we're dealing with a hue here we have two separate markers we're in need.

25
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:03,210
She can pass any list of markers type so I can go in and say little O for one marker and then lowercase

26
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,300
V for another and these markers these symbols come from the map plus lib marker symbols.

27
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:15,990
So go to and run that and then we see we have upside then triangles for females and circles for males

28
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,350
.

29
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:22,110
Now if that's actually not large enough for you to see you can go ahead and begin to add in what's known

30
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:31,020
as a scatter underscore k s parameter and basically what that means is I'm can actually passen map plot

31
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,710
lib parameters even more directly into the Piel t that scatter call.

32
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,520
So what seaborne is doing with this.

33
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,180
S and s l m plot is it's actually calling map plot lib very much under the hood.

34
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:50,220
And if you want to effect map plot lived directly from seaborne what you end up doing and this kind

35
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,520
of on a case by case basis so you have to reference the documentation as necessary.

36
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:02,340
But if you want to for this case affect the scatterplot you're going to pass any dictionary so I can

37
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,550
go ahead and say s dictionary and change the size to something like 100.

38
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,000
And this will actually affect the size of these markers.

39
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,270
You're going to run that show you and I have made the markers a lot bigger.

40
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,940
So this is actually just a call to map plot lib and what's going on underneath the hood of Seaborn.

41
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,650
In other words you're just passing any dictionary with base map plot lib arguments and in this case

42
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:25,850
it's.

43
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,960
As for size of a scatterplot in general you probably won't remember this kind of thing off the top of

44
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,900
your head but is that reference the documentation.

45
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,810
And you probably won't be customizing to this degree that often with Seaborn.

46
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,430
You'll go ahead and customize your data first before doing this sort of action.

47
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,060
Let's go ahead and show you a couple of more options here.

48
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:52,410
In case you don't want to mess around with marker sizing you can actually use a grid instead of separating

49
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:59,500
by Hugh so you can add more by saying Asinus thought Ellen plot.

50
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:08,390
Let's go ahead and copy and paste the bill tip and data and we're going to go ahead and do it.

51
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,080
After seeing this instead of specifying something like Heugh equals sex which changes the color hue

52
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,760
you can actually start calling factor or grid plot's like saying call equal sex for columns.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,060
And now you have to separate column plots here separated by the sex category.

54
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,110
So male versus female.

55
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:37,140
So instead of separating it by color separated by columns and you can continue this sort of logic on

56
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,040
rows as well.

57
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:45,510
If you want to add in another variable to see you can say row is equal to something like the time column

58
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,130
and now you have rows and times and this is essentially just doing the grid calls and the Fassett group

59
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,130
calls that we learned about earlier in the grid lecture.

60
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,360
But it's a little more automatic because we're just adding call and row to the L-M plot call.

61
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,790
So it makes it a lot easier.

62
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,220
Now we don't have to deal Fassett great all the time.

63
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:11,250
Now if for some reason you still want to plot more variables you can add the hugh back end so you could

64
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,750
say Heugh is equal to let's say another column.

65
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,920
I want to go in and say column is day that we have Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday is column.

66
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,380
It's going to change the hue back to sex.

67
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,040
So this going to give us quite informative plot but it's going to be a lot of information here so you

68
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,900
can see there's a lot going on here and a lot of information.

69
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,610
So you probably just want to go ahead and eliminate row right off the bat and only get one column back

70
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,290
or one Roback excuse me and then we have kind of a nice looking plot here but the problem is that the

71
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,430
aspect and size look wrong.

72
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,990
So Seaborn figures going to have their size and aspect ratio adjusted with size and aspect parameters

73
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,290
.

74
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:04,380
So you go into your seaborne call and then you can change the aspect ratio with aspect so it's good

75
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,170
and give it an aspect ratio of 0.6.

76
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:11,460
And this is the ratio between the height and the width of each of these separate grids.

77
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:18,370
And then you can specify size to change the sizes to specify size 8.

78
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,520
And here he began to affect the aspect and size ratio of this.

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,960
And now you're probably wondering well how do I change the font size is still too small to read or how

80
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,150
do I control the aesthetics even more.

81
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,700
Well we're going to do is lead this into our style and color lecture which is coming up next where we're

82
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:42,780
going to show you how to control these more basic features of the plot such as font size style coloring

83
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,950
etc..

84
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,950
As far as this lecture is concerned we're pretty much done.

85
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,360
The main thing I want you to get out of this is that in order to call a linear model plot you just call

86
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:58,140
s and s l m plot passen your x y column and set your data and then you can passen Hugh for these more

87
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,130
advanced features such as setting the marker size or changing the marker type.

88
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,420
Go ahead and reference the note book and the link to the documentation in the notebook.

89
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,050
All right.

90
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,450
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&A forum and I'll be happy to help you out.

91
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,560
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
