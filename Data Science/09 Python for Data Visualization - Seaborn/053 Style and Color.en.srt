00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,460
Hello everyone and welcome to the style and colour lecture.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,690
We've shown a few times how to control figure aesthetics and seaborne But now we're going to go over

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,150
it in a more formal manner.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,600
Let's go ahead and jump to Jupiter notebook to get started.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,370
All right here we are at the Jupiter notebook.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,140
I've gone ahead and done the usual import seaborne set matplotlib line and went ahead and loaded up

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,250
the tips data set.

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,120
Let me go in and show you how you can set particular styles.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:40,730
For instance I can do SNL star count plots and let's say the sex column in passen tips as my data whoops

10
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:49,890
data equal tips in here I have my accounts plot's seaborne has a set style arguments which allows you

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,220
to set the style for the rest of your plots.

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:58,650
And if we go and do shift Tampere to check out the underscore style you basically pass in a parameter

13
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,650
for style and that's a string.

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,060
It can be dark grid white grid dark white or Tick's we're going to show you what this looks like pressing

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:15,000
and whites will go ahead and creates a blank white background for you if you passen tick ticks.

16
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,670
I should say you basically get these ticks at the edge of the box.

17
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,590
Then there's also dark grid

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,320
which gives you the original Dark grid background.

19
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,660
And then there's also what I really like.

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,150
White grid gives you both the clarity of white but also the grid.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,720
So you don't lose that information.

22
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,430
You can go ahead and kind of messroom set style and see which ones you prefer or like the best.

23
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,290
Now another thing you can do is remove spines.

24
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,460
So right now you can still see let me go in and set this equal to ticks so it's very clear what we're

25
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,470
doing here.

26
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,960
So we have these spine's the top spine and the right spine as well as the bottom and left hand spine

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,400
.

28
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:06,960
If you want to go ahead and remove those you can just say Asinus the spine and it will remove the top

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,930
spine and the right spine if you want to continue removing the bottom or left spine.

30
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,230
You can actually add those in as parameters.

31
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:21,570
So basically top right left and bottom by default top and right are true to be removed left and bottom

32
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,760
or not to be removed.

33
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,640
But you can specify that you do want them removed by saying leftest true and then bottom is true.

34
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,500
This will remove basically all four spines.

35
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,670
So if you get if you're looking for something that's like a very clear and nice looking polished plot

36
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,220
maybe you want to present it without any spines.

37
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,090
I personally prefer spines in there so I'm gonna go ahead and remove that and keep those spines.

38
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,740
Now let's talk about size and aspect.

39
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,560
You can use map plot libs peel t figure big size width and height to actually change the size of most

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,460
Seaborn blocks.

41
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,310
So they are all just basic callbacks to map lit and you can also control the size and aspect ratio of

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,080
a seaborn grid plots by passing in the parameters size and aspect.

43
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,730
Let me go to show you what I mean by all this.

44
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,960
I'm going to go ahead and call the count plots and note that the set style even if I delete it will

45
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:21,450
stay in place until I say a new style but I'm going to call it go appeal t that figure and say fix size

46
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,800
is equal to.

47
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,230
We're going into say 12 by 3.

48
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:32,700
And note that this actually overrides or is a callback when seaborne is calling Matt plot lib.

49
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,030
Madlib will actually set the figure size for the Seaborn plot.

50
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,210
So you can use or map plot lived knowledge as far as figure sizing and aspect ratios here in combination

51
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,240
with seaborne.

52
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,990
Now let's go ahead and touch on the topic of scale and context.

53
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:55,200
SEABORNE comes a convenient set underscore context which allows you to override default parameters and

54
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,940
change Funt scales depending on what you're actually creating the figure for.

55
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,690
So let's say you are going to create this figure not for a notebook but actually for a poster.

56
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:15,060
You can go ahead and say Asinus thought underscore context and context will take a couple of parameters

57
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,130
.

58
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,300
Take context.

59
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,920
And that's going to be a string and it also takes a font scale the context parameters are paper notebook

60
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,700
talk or poster.

61
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,520
So if I go and just set the context the context excuse me to poster notice that I get a much larger

62
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,020
figure out and the font is also larger because it assumes that you're going to be putting this on a

63
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,890
poster.

64
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,570
And if you're still unsatisfied with the font size you can go ahead and add that to the arguments of

65
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,840
font underscore scale to a larger number maybe three.

66
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,610
So it's three times the size of the default.

67
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:56,130
And here you could actually set the context for whatever you want the figure to be and usually by default

68
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,950
it's going to be in the context of a notebook.

69
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:06,060
So you can go to say notebook and that sets the context of your figures.

70
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,480
All right.

71
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,460
We've got over just a few of the basics here.

72
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,210
The last thing I want to talk about are palettes and colors.

73
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,800
We've shown plots before we actually specify a hue parameter.

74
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,730
Let me go in and show an example of that.

75
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:26,940
For instance when we said S.N. s n s Lim plots maybe we want to do total bill versus the tip

76
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:37,380
and then passen tips as the data set whip's data equals IPs.

77
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,170
So we were able to previously specify something like Heugh is equal to six.

78
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,100
And then we get these colors chosen for us green and blue.

79
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,560
And we've seen earlier that we can actually pass in a Hallett's arguments and there are certain strings

80
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,890
we can put in that essentially give you a color map and we've seen the similar aspects for things such

81
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,890
as the heat maps.

82
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,600
When I put in things like magma or cool warm.

83
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,910
Now you may be wondering what we're you actually find these strings.

84
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,420
Well you can find them by going to map plot lives color map page.

85
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,350
Let me go to show you how to do this with Google.

86
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,050
You can go ahead.

87
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,680
Open a new tab and go to Google and look up.

88
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:27,210
Matt plot's live color map and it will take you to one of these pages and we're looking for is the color

89
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,790
map documentation page.

90
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,940
And this is usually the first link here.

91
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,820
There's color example code.

92
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:40,350
And if we come to this page now we can see the actual color scale and the gradients as well as the name

93
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,860
or string name you need to passen for the color map.

94
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:50,130
So if we zoom out here we can see these four color maps these are the main color maps but there's also

95
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,660
sequential color maps.

96
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:59,280
So sequential two color maps another set diverging color maps qualitative color maps miscellaneous and

97
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,310
those are your options as far as the strings you passen.

98
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:09,570
So for example let's say I wanted to choose this seismic diverging color map for the hue that I just

99
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:17,150
come over here and instead of coor by passen seismic place felt that right.

100
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,380
And here we can now see I get this kind of purple and red which were the colors here at both ends at

101
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,020
this diverging color map.

102
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,330
And you can go ahead and play around these color maps.

103
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,390
There are a lot of fun to play with.

104
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,380
When Seaborn to get your plot to look exactly like you want it to.

105
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,360
All right.

106
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,070
You can go ahead and check out the Jupiter note book for style and color to get a lot more information

107
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:43,260
and check out the links in that page or in that note book which takes you to the official documentation

108
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:48,240
which has even more information about really controlling more of your aesthetics and your figure.

109
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:54,220
But the main thing to understand to know are that you can look up these palette codes with MAP live

110
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,660
looking up color maps.

111
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:02,700
You can change the font size with set underscore context setting context to either poster or notebook

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,300
and then changing the font scale.

113
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,530
And then you can use piquante that figure with Fig sized to actually change the size of your figures

114
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,060
.

115
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,770
All right I hope you enjoyed this and I hope you enjoyed Seaborn.

116
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,300
Coming up next are some seaborne exercises free to add to.

117
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:18,770
All right.

118
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,520
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture
