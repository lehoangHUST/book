00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,830
Hello everyone and welcome to Matrix plot's lecture with Seaborn in this lecture we're going to learn

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,940
how to create matrix plots primarily heat maps using Seaborn.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,300
Let's go ahead and jump to Jupiter notebook to get started.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,200
OK.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,500
Here I am at the Jupiter notebook.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,280
I went ahead and said inport seaborne as Asinus and then set map plot live in line.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,970
Then I loaded up two data sets.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,550
I've loaded up the tips data frame or data set using Esson as that load underscore data set and then

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,260
passing in the string tips.

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,660
And I did a similar thing for the flight data set using S and S that low data set and then passing in

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,030
the string flights the tips data that we've seen before.

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,980
Here's the head of it.

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,430
But the flight data set we haven't.

14
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,970
So let's take a quick look at it.

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,130
The flight data set primarily just shows the number of passengers that flew in a given month of a given

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,750
year.

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:04,230
Now let's talk about heat maps which is our primary way of showing some sort of matrix plot in order

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,630
for a heat map to work properly.

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,630
Your data should already be in a matrix form.

20
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,850
And what I mean by matrix form is so that the index name and the column name match up so that the cell

21
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:21,500
value actually indicates something that is relevant to both of those names.

22
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:28,680
What I mean by that for instance if I take a look at the tips data frame right now I have a total bill

23
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,850
which is some sort of label or variable and if I look at one of the values in the cell it's 16 dollars

24
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,950
and 99 cents.

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,420
However the row is not an actual variable in order to get this into matrix form.

26
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,830
I need to have both variables on the columns and the rows.

27
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:54,420
I can do that through many methods usually through a pivot table or trying to get correlation data.

28
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,860
We'll go ahead and do correlation data first.

29
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:02,130
If I call it tips stop c o r r close parentheses.

30
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,290
Now we have a matrix form of some sort of data here.

31
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:15,390
And what you mean by that is now the column and the index variable names actually indicates a relevancy

32
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,880
to both the column and the index name for the cell where they match up.

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,190
And this is the matrix form.

34
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,370
You're going to need your data in in order to call heat map on it and then it's actually just as simple

35
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,920
as calling Asinus dot heat map and then your data.

36
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:39,500
Let's go in and save Tipps thought core as TC and then pass it into heat map.

37
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,840
And here we can see a heat map or a heat map really does is it colors in those values based on some

38
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,280
sort of gradient scale.

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,850
So if I take a look at my original TCE data frame it's essentially just set these numbers to a gradient

40
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,970
on a color scale and then fill that in.

41
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,380
And that way if you have a very large correlation data frame or some other matrix form data you can

42
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:07,390
easily tell what the numbers are what the values are relative to each other using a heat map.

43
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,210
And that's the main primary use for a matrix plot.

44
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:18,420
Other useful arguments you can pass in here to heat map besides just your data is and rotation so you

45
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:26,160
can say A and OT as arguments equals true and they will annotate the actual numerical values that belong

46
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,350
in each of these cells.

47
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,680
You don't just have to go off of color but you can also go off of the actual value here.

48
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:38,730
And then you can also specify as See map the actual color mapping you want will go over color maps and

49
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,580
the options later on in the seemore lecturers for instance showing an example.

50
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,070
Cool warm as a string that verifies a color map.

51
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,200
And here you can begin to see the color map.

52
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,650
Cool warm on the same data.

53
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:59,700
Now let's revisit the flight's data then go ahead and type in flights and we can see we have all this

54
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,640
year this month this passengers and I need to get this into matrix form meaning I need to somehow convert

55
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:13,510
one of these variables appear to be the call or the road names the actual index.

56
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,500
So I want one of these variables either Year Month or passengers.

57
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,340
Let's go ahead and say month to be the index.

58
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,330
So I'm going to say the index is equal to month and then I'm going to go out and set the columns equal

59
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:36,330
to the year and then the only thing I have left to do is specify the values and that's going to go ahead

60
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,920
and be the passengers column.

61
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,400
Go in and run this and see what this looks like now.

62
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,310
OK.

63
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,940
Now I have my data in some sort of matrix form.

64
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,600
You can do this with Pivot Table quite easily depending if your data lines up correctly.

65
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,470
Now you can see I have a bunch of numbers here that correlate well with not just the column variable

66
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,360
but also the index variable.

67
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:07,570
So I can see here in 1952 for instance in April there were 181 passengers.

68
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,770
Now what I want to do is use heat map to quickly visualize this data.

69
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,280
I'm going to go head and set this equal to FP for flights pivot and then just call S and S heat map

70
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,820
on F-P.

71
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,530
And here we can see the heat map for the pivoted tables of flights.

72
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,710
And now I can see based on a color gradient the data in a lot clear of a format.

73
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,400
So I can easily tell which month of which year had the most flights and it makes sense that gradually

74
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:43,030
as the years go further or forward in time you get more flights then that makes sense because as time

75
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,950
goes on more people are on airplanes more flights are occurring and you can also see based off the month

76
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:56,530
that popular month travel is usually during the summer months June July and August at least for us data

77
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,330
.

78
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:04,510
Now what you can also do is add in arguments such as sea map and let's go in and show another example

79
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,800
of a sea map one that's useful as magma.

80
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:16,570
And now we can also see from dark to light the actual colors here the variation in other argument you

81
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:23,410
can pass and a heat map which sometimes people like to use is like color and line which is

82
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,870
basically right now in this heat map.

83
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,560
All these cells are touching each other directly but sometimes you may want some separation.

84
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,140
So you can specify line withs to be a little thicker.

85
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,740
We'll go in and put in one there and you can auspice Feitel the line color.

86
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,970
We're going to go and specify it to be white.

87
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,830
Now if I run this I get these lines in between each cell.

88
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,890
And sometimes that's a little easier to read.

89
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,790
You can make these lines really thick if you want more separation and you can also change the color

90
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,740
of the line.

91
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,750
So for instance if I go back to maybe another seam up another one sometimes people use like we show

92
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,480
before us cool warm.

93
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,500
And this is what it would look like maybe you want something that's not white.

94
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,130
You can also choose like black for instance.

95
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,760
So really you have a lot of customization here as far as how you actually want to separate this.

96
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,890
Let's go to remove everything and just show the original heat map here.

97
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:27,340
Now let's talk about the second Matrix type plot in seaborne which is the cluster map and the cluster

98
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:33,260
map is actually going to use hierarchal clustering to produce a clustered version of this heat map.

99
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:37,900
Let me go to show you an example here we have the original heat map but now I'm going to call Asinus

100
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:45,420
cluster map on F.P. and notice what we have here.

101
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,470
We have the data on it need to zoom out to show this completely.

102
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:55,540
But now we have the data and these little hierarchal clusters and this basically tries to cluster columns

103
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,180
and rows together based off their similarity.

104
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:06,730
And this suddenly shows the years and the months and clusters and the months here on the y axis you

105
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,370
can see are no longer in order.

106
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,400
They go September June August July October April.

107
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:16,270
And the reason for that is because they've been clustered to most similar months being put together

108
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,810
and the same thing for years you can see certain years are now out of order.

109
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,940
It goes 1949 1950 1953.

110
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:28,570
That is basically clusters of information to try to show columns and rows that are similar to each other

111
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,360
so I can see now that 1959 and 1960 are very similar to each other.

112
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,250
And so our August and July.

113
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:40,570
And you can see the different levels of the hierarchy of the clusters based off of these kind of tree

114
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:48,550
diagrams but on the y axis and the x axis and now you can really begin to infer information from a plot

115
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,020
in order to make this even more clear what we can do is change the color mapping.

116
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,210
So see map equal to the string.

117
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,020
Cool warm again.

118
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,250
And now we can really see the clusters so you can see that there's a cluster between August and July

119
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,420
very clearly and something else you can do is standardize the scale.

120
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,400
So right now we're still on passengers from 0 to 600.

121
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:19,690
But if you wanted to normalize this you can passen arguments called standard scale and input 1 and this

122
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:26,920
would normalize this from 0 to 1 and you can really see based off a normalized scale the similarities

123
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,890
of the clusters based off the coloring.

124
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:35,800
So it looks like this November January and February is kind of early winter months are much closer to

125
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,120
low passengers and high passenger count is mainly in these summer months.

126
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:41,770
OK.

127
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,010
I encourage you to go ahead and explore the documentation for cluster map.

128
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,720
It is something you're interested in but you may want to wait until we actually get to machine learning

129
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,460
clustering algorithms so we can better understand what's actually going on with the mathematics behind

130
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,360
these methods.

131
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,770
BERNANKE I just think of it as an interesting method to just infer a little more information from a

132
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:06,400
normal heat than a heat map will display things in the order you put them in a cluster map will cluster

133
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,890
things in an order so that similar groups are close to each other.

134
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,930
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
