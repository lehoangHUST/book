Hello everyone and welcome to Seaborn exercises overview lecture and this lecture we're going to briefly

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,060
go over the seaborne exercises before we show you these solutions in the next lecture.

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,190
Let's go in and jump to Jupiter notebook to get started.

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,980
All right here I am at the Jupiter notebook for the Seaborn exercises located under the Seaborn folder

5
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,250
and we're going to be working with a famous Titanic dataset.

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,220
And you can actually load this directly from Seaborn.

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,710
So a lot of this code is already laid out for you.

8
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,220
These force these first four cells are laid out for you and you can check out the head of the Titanic

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,230
data frame and what it looks like.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,410
And basically the exercises are wanting you to recreate the plots shown here below using this titanic

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,960
data frame and there's very few hints since most of the plots can actually just be done with just one

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,950
or maybe two lines of code and a hint would basically give away the solution.

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,790
So essentially just showing you the plot and asking you to replicate it.

14
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,010
Something you should really know here is that in order not to lose this plot image you shouldn't run

15
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,720
any code in the cell that correctly above it.

16
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,540
So for out 41 you shouldn't run any code in 41.

17
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,860
What you should do is be running your code right here.

18
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,140
So code here in order to not remove this exercise plot image.

19
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,590
All right.

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,360
I want you to replicate this plot right here.

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,630
This plot this box plot and then this swarm plot and then this plot right here.

22
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,200
Pay careful attention to the y axis for this guy and replicate this plot.

23
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,170
And then finally replicate this plot.

24
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,260
Notice how it's two separate grids here.

25
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:43,890
All right.

26
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,870
That's it for this Seaborn exercise lecture in the next lecture we're all actually code out these solutions

27
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,460
and explain as we go along.

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,940
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
