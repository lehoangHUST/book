00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,050
Hello everyone and welcome to the Seaborn exercises solution's lecture this lecture.

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,990
We're going to go over the solutions for the seaborne exercises.

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,320
Let's go ahead and jump to Jupiter notebook to get started.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,170
All right here I am at the Jupiter notebook we have the data and load it up and we're going to go ahead

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,550
and jump to the first plot we want to replicate.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,860
All right looking at this plot hopefully you can tell that this is a distribution plot and it's actually

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,380
the joint plot because you're showing two distributions on top of each other and then you could have

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,690
read this and seen that it's the fair versus the age of the data set.

9
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,210
Let's go ahead and show you how we can run this.

10
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,430
We're going to run these lines again.

11
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,990
So I actually import everything correctly and then I'm going to go ahead and type in my code.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:00,270
So this is a joint plot's where you have the fair

13
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:14,910
and on the y axis you have age and our dataset is just the Titanic data and that will replicate that

14
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,030
plot for you.

15
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,430
Again it's just a joint plot.

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,480
All right.

17
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,490
Coming up next is this distribution plot.

18
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,460
And this is a this plots so you can just see Asinus this plot.

19
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,090
Titanic and then pass and the column we want and if we take a look here at the bottom this is the Fair

20
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:36,880
column.

21
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,270
So the distribution of the Fair column.

22
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,910
Let me go to put this just this line by itself as a new plots.

23
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,710
All right.

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,430
So this is what you get when you see just as soon as this plot something you want to do in order to

25
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,740
replicate this plot is remove this Cady's.

26
00:01:52,750 --> 00:02:00,760
So I want to go and say easy cool false here and now we're getting a little closer.

27
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,050
Something else to note here is that the color is red.

28
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:11,280
So you can also specify color equals red although as I mentioned the instructions you don't have to

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,010
worry too much about the actual colors.

30
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,510
And then there's also less bends here in the fair.

31
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:23,310
So after experimenting with some bin's numbers you can hopefully discover that the bins are around 30

32
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,820
for the plot.

33
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,020
And so that's the actual code for the plot.

34
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,920
The distribution plot.

35
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,730
In this case this plot Titanic fair equals false and then some extra information read in bins.

36
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,830
If you were able to get red or the bin's argument don't worry about that.

37
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,090
The only thing I'm really concerned about you recognizing is that this was a plot with the Eagles false

38
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,400
on the Fair column.

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,290
OK moving on to the next plot.

40
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:55,860
This is clearly a box plot and it looks like the class is on the x axis and the age is on the y axis

41
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,190
.

42
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,440
Let's go ahead and check that out.

43
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:08,910
In order to do this all you have to say is as Sinistar box plot as in the class and then pass in the

44
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,320
age for y and then the data is equal to the Titanic data set.

45
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,670
We can go ahead and run that.

46
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,750
And one last thing which doesn't matter if you didn't get it or not but the actual color scheme is the

47
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,900
rainbow color scheme.

48
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,900
So we can also specify palettes is equal to Rainbow.

49
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,830
And again don't worry if we were able to get the color to match I just want you to recognize that it's

50
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,540
a box plot and then be able to read the X versus the Y and fill that in.

51
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,580
Moving on to the next one sounds a little trickier because it's the swarm plot in which you have to

52
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:51,540
do is say as soon as the swarm plot and this is actually everything the same as far as class versus

53
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,780
age so you can actually just come up here.

54
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:01,030
Copy all this is going and copy everything including the palette and just have this one plot.

55
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,970
This is the Suaram plot version of the box plot we just showed.

56
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,960
And this color scheme in case you're curious of what it was.

57
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:14,310
This is actually the set to color scheme but again don't worry if we're not able to get the color seemed

58
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:14,670
correct.

59
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,890
That doesn't really matter what I want should be able to get correct is the x y and data source for

60
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,080
swarm plot.

61
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,290
Next one that we want to check out was this bar plot.

62
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,260
But take careful note that it says count here.

63
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:36,070
So is actually a counterplot and you can create a counterplot just by saying S and S counterplot passing

64
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,210
the column you want to count.

65
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:46,530
In this case we take a look over here see sex column in our data source is the Titanic data frame and

66
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,730
that's the plot right there.

67
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,830
Color scheme is the original color scheme that we have this plot right here.

68
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,170
Sounds a little trickier.

69
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:02,640
Notice that we have values between negative 1 and once it goes from this cool war mapping and the other

70
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:09,990
hint here is that you can see at the very top the title is titanic dot c o r r c is clearly a correlation

71
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,780
plot and we want to use heape map on this.

72
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,730
So we're going to go ahead and do this.

73
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:27,510
We're going to say Asinus heat map and pasand Titanic dark core and we can also say sea map is equal

74
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,050
to cool warm.

75
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,580
And this is going to replicate that plot in the solutions notebook.

76
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,980
I also added a title on this called P.L..

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,670
The title Titanic got c o r r.

78
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,540
Close parentheses.

79
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,590
And that was actually just to give you a hint as you were looking at the figure as to what the information

80
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,270
actually was.

81
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,960
All right.

82
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,210
Let's go ahead and move on to the last plot which is a little tricky because this one's using Fassett

83
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,220
grid system is going to be done in two lines.

84
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,520
First off let's take a look at what we're actually doing.

85
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,420
It looks like the columns are sex equals male and sex equals female.

86
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:15,210
So we want to create a Fassett grid separated by the column sex organ of say data is equal to Titanic

87
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,950
and call is equal to sex.

88
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:24,840
And then I'm going to go out and set that equal to g as we did in the earlier examples and then I'm

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,780
going to map it looks like this is a histogram.

90
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,330
So there's different ways of doing this.

91
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,590
But the easiest way is to say peel t the highest and then the arguments actually want to do a histogram

92
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,960
of his age.

93
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,320
So you could have done that which you could have also done is to get a similar plot.

94
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:47,090
Exactly the same is just plot this sort of also shown a K the top.

95
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,190
OK.

96
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,730
I hope you found this interesting and I hope you found really the true power of seaborne to create beautiful

97
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,800
visualizations and just very few lines of code as long as you have your data framed set up correctly

98
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,220
.

99
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,360
OK.

100
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,530
Go ahead and post any questions you have to the Q&A forums and check out the Juber new book If You Want

101
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,270
some more reference code.

102
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,180
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
