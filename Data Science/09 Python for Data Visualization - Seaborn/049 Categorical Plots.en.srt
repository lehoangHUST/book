00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,590
Hello everyone and welcome to the categorical plot's lecture for the seaborne S. discourse.

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,030
Now we're going to shift our focus to plugging categorical data.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,760
Let's go ahead and jump to Jupiter notebook to get started.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,950
OK here I am at the Jupiter notebook and I've already put in a couple of lines of code here.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,440
I said import Seaborn and Cessna's I went ahead and said map plot in line so I can see the visualizations

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,150
inside of the Jupiter notebook.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,530
And then I went ahead and loaded the tips data set and then I checked out the head of the tips data

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:42,840
set OK for categorical plots were mainly going to be concerned about seeing the distributions of a categorical

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:50,790
column such as this sex gender or smoker daytime in reference either to one of the numerical columns

10
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,450
or another categorical column.

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,610
Let's go ahead and start off with the most basic categorical plot which is the bar plots and you can

12
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:06,510
do that by calling Asness bar plots and a bar plot is just a general plot that allows you to aggregate

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,940
the categorical data based off of some function and by default that's the mean you can almost think

14
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,190
of this as a visualization of a group by action.

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,400
Let me go ahead and show you what I mean by that.

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,350
We're going to go in and set an x y and data arguments into bar plot all sort of data sets the easiest

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,830
tips and then what I'm going to do and do is set the x axis to a categorical column.

18
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,760
In this case I'll go ahead and choose the sex column here.

19
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:43,110
And then for the Y column or yeah for the y axes we can choose a column that's numeric for instance

20
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,470
total bill.

21
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,320
And this will create a bar plots and by default what it's showing you here is the average or mean of

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,510
the total bill.

23
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,800
Her categorical column value.

24
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:02,640
So the average total bill for males is going to be slightly higher than the average total bill for females

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,200
.

26
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:09,780
And you can go ahead and change what's known as the estimator object if you want to basically affect

27
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,270
what the actual grouping or aggregation here is.

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:21,480
And we can go ahead and do that by adding another argument here estimator.

29
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,370
And here we're going to do shift tabs.

30
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,300
You can actually see the Jupiter notebooks documentation for this.

31
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,850
The estimator is a function that is an aggregate function.

32
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,900
So it's some sort of statistical function to estimate within each categorical bin and by default that's

33
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,630
going to be average or mean.

34
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,310
But I can also put in my own functions if you have some sort of aggregate function you can go ahead

35
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,360
and put that out.

36
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,380
Right now we're looking at the mean total bill.

37
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,820
But let's say we wanted to figure out the standard deviation her gender for instance.

38
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,560
Is there more standard deviation on males and their total bill.

39
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,860
So more variance or do females have more variance.

40
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,130
Well we're going to get into say important some pie as we go to copy and paste this and put it in a

41
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,040
cell above this.

42
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,170
Go ahead and insert the cell above and was say important up-I as NPE here.

43
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:20,670
And then in the estimator I'm going to go ahead and passen the pie t d function for standard deviation

44
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:27,630
and this will tell me when I run this what the standard deviation of the total bill column is per category

45
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,050
.

46
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,510
And you can pass in whatever estimator function you want.

47
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,730
You can even create your own.

48
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,380
And you can pass it into bar plot where x is a category column and Y is some sort of numerical column

49
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:37,590
.

50
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,750
Then you passed your data and whatever estimator.

51
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,700
And this is just an aggregate or essentially just a visualization of some sort of group by mechanism

52
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,840
here.

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:54,840
All right let's go ahead and build off of this by doing a count plot a count plots in seaborne is essentially

54
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,170
the same as a bar plot except the estimator is explicitly counting the number of occurrences.

55
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:09,020
And because of that we only set the x value and then we sit in the data equals tips.

56
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,840
And this is essentially the same thing as saying like Pandas Thumb counts off of this tips column for

57
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,310
gender.

58
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:18,730
All right.

59
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,580
Now that's the basics of the counterplot is essentially the same as a bar plot except the y axis has

60
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,820
already been chosen for you.

61
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,500
It's going to just count the occurrences.

62
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,570
Here we can see there's more males in the dataset than females.

63
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,800
Let's move on and talk about box plots and violent plots.

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,770
These type of plots are used to show that distribution of categorical data a box plot is also sometimes

65
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,710
known as a box and whisker plot.

66
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,220
And it shows the distribution of quantitative data in a way that hopefully facilitates comparisons between

67
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,130
the variables.

68
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,710
Me going to show you what I mean by that.

69
00:04:50,940 --> 00:05:00,630
I'm going to create a box plot by say S and S that box plot then we're going to pass an x and y in this

70
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,820
case I will choose X to be a categorical data points or column.

71
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,550
And then why is going to be numerical.

72
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,560
It's going to go total bill.

73
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,220
So here we're going to try to see the distribution of total bill per day.

74
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,170
And then lastly I have to pass that data as tips.

75
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,460
Let's go ahead and run this.

76
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,730
And here we get our box plot out.

77
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,400
OK.

78
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,640
This box plot shows the core tiles of the data set while the whiskers extend to show the rest of the

79
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,600
distribution except for these points that are outside of these whiskers.

80
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:40,710
These are determined to be outliers and you can essentially just interpret this as from for instance

81
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,960
if we look at Thursday as a day by itself we have on the y axis total bill.

82
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,100
And then on the X-axis it's just separated by category or day.

83
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,770
So if I look at this blue one right here all the way on the left for Thursday it's essentially telling

84
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,130
me that about 25 percent or a quarter.

85
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,430
Which is why these are called core tiles are the data points go from the center of the whisper to the

86
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,190
bottom here and then another quarter go from the bottom of the box to the middle here.

87
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,460
This line and then etc for the top.

88
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,070
So but now about another quarter the points are here and then the other quarter of the points are here

89
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,460
.

90
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:22,920
And these dots are outliers and we can begin to get really fancy with seaborne by just adding a few

91
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,820
more words of code here and specify a hue.

92
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,480
And that's going to allow us to kind of split up these box plots even further by another categorical

93
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,590
categorical column.

94
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,470
In this case we'll go ahead and say Heugh equals smoker.

95
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:46,080
If I run this now I see the box plots split per day and also split by smoker status and smoker status

96
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,620
is colored here for you.

97
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,030
And here you can now compare not only.

98
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:55,150
Day by day behavior for total bill but also by whether or not this person is a smoker.

99
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,990
And that's really the true power behind seaborne.

100
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,060
It quickly allows you to add this hue indicator which essentially gives you a whole another layer of

101
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,000
data very quickly and very smoothly.

102
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:13,500
And so you can compare that basically people on Fridays tend to have a larger bill if they're not a

103
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:19,950
smoker versus if they are a smoker and then you can begin to actually see the variation for smokers

104
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:24,450
or that distribution for smokers and non-smokers.

105
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,450
All right let's go ahead and talk about violent plots now going to go ahead and remove this hue here

106
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:38,400
so we can see our original box plot and then I'm going to call a violent plot and a violent plot plays

107
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,630
a very similar role to a box plot.

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,930
And you can do it just because in essence that violent plot.

109
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,550
And what's going to do is it's also going to show the distribution of the data across some sort of category

110
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,000
.

111
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:56,370
So it's going to take the exact same arguments as a box plot is going to take an x for the category

112
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,060
.

113
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,460
Your wife is going to be some sort of numerical column is going to stick with total bill and then it

114
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,170
will pass in our data.

115
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,260
CBS is going to go ahead and run this and see what these plots look like and let me zoom out so we can

116
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,040
actually compare these two.

117
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,250
All right.

118
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,920
So we have our box on top and our violin on the bottom.

119
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:25,350
Now the violin plot unlike the box plot allows us to actually plot all the components that correspond

120
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:31,650
to actual data points and it's essentially showing the kernel density estimation of the underlying distribution

121
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,960
.

122
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,930
And this is essentially just showing if we kind of split this in half the distribution of the points

123
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:43,290
on its side and this allows you to reveal even more information about the data points themselves the

124
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:49,980
cost comes at the fact that it's a little harder to interpret or read versus a box plop a box plot is

125
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:56,460
very easy to just take a look at and you can quickly tell where roughly the data compares on a category

126
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,700
in violent plots.

127
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,840
We'll just give you a lot more information as far as the distribution of all the points themselves.

128
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,470
But it kind of comes at the cost they have to spend a little more time looking at it and understanding

129
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,000
it.

130
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,560
But these two plots are definitely very related to each other.

131
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,660
It's just that the violent plot shows a little more information.

132
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,180
Sometimes this information can be hidden from you if you're just using a box plot and a violent plot

133
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,650
just like the box plot.

134
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,860
Also has the option to do Whew.

135
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:32,080
So I could say you buy sex and Ill show me violent plots next to each other.

136
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,710
Well what's interesting about the violent plot versus the box plot is as another argument instead of

137
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:43,680
putting two violent plots next to each other since the violin plot information essentially doubled up

138
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:43,930
.

139
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:50,040
I could have one half be one here and the other half be an other and you can do that by saying split

140
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:57,310
equals true as an argument and then it will kind of split the distributions.

141
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,130
And here you have a lot more information.

142
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,360
Now you can directly compare the distributions based off in another category and see how the categories

143
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,080
themselves on the x axis compare to each other.

144
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,000
Granted this comes again at the cost that you're going to spend more time looking at this visualization

145
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,390
.

146
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,600
So you really have to know your audience and know what's appropriate when you're using seaboard and

147
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,210
these advanced visualizations if you're dealing with some more technical data is people who are data

148
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,310
scientists themselves and have seen violent plots before these sort of plots are a great choice.

149
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:36,120
However for dealing with more kind of CEO executive types management people maybe just a simple box

150
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,250
plot which is more popular may be the correct choice unless you find something very interesting in the

151
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,140
violent plot.

152
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:49,290
All right let's go ahead and talk about a few more advanced methods for visualizing this sort of categorical

153
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,200
data.

154
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,570
We'll start off with the strip plot and the stript plot is actually probably the simplest but we're

155
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,510
going to build off of it and we're going to zoom in here.

156
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:05,400
We're going to get and say essence strip plot and the strip plot is going to draw a scatterplot where

157
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,140
one variable is categorical.

158
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:12,270
So I'm going to say strip plot and we're going to do the exact same thing was that before X is going

159
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:18,940
to be categorical y is going to be numeric total bill.

160
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,820
And the data is going to be equal to tips.

161
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:30,670
And this is just a essentially just a scatterplot based off of the category one issue with this strip

162
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,100
plot is that you can't really tell how many points are stacked on top of each other which you can do

163
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,770
is at another argument called jitter and what jitter will do if we go in and say is true here.

164
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,640
Is this going to add a little bit of random noise to separate some of these stacked points.

165
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,610
And you can see the thicker and more points there are a lot more clear versus just the normal strip

166
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,280
plot.

167
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,710
So the normal stript plot if he had a bunch of points stacked on top of each other it was kind of hard

168
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,550
to tell.

169
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:06,240
But now if you can see the density a little better in with the strip plot just like a violent plot you

170
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,830
can begin adding some of those extra few arguments.

171
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,540
So again we could say hewe is equal to something like sex.

172
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:19,310
Run this and now I have color based cues and we can also do a split on this just like we could have

173
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:26,170
fake violent plot and this will basically split up these colors based off of your schewe arguments.

174
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,770
OK.

175
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:33,030
Now a plot like this again you got to be careful of it it may be hard to interpret versus a simple box

176
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,170
plot or even a violent plot.

177
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,320
Some people like to actually combine the idea of a strip plot versus a violent plot and create something

178
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:48,060
that's known as a swarm plot and Seaborn allows you to actually do this.

179
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,790
A swarm plot.

180
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,730
We go out and start typing.

181
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:56,210
It is very similar to strip plot except the points are adjusted so that they don't overlap.

182
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,760
And this actually gives a better representation of the distribution of values.

183
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,520
It's kind of like combining a scatterplot strip plot with a violent plot.

184
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,890
Let me going to show you what I mean by that.

185
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,190
There will probably be a little more obvious when you see it.

186
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,060
We're going to go ahead and pass in the exact same arguments day for x.

187
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,170
We'll say why is total bill.

188
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:15,520
Whoops

189
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:25,090
total underscore bill and then we'll say data is tips.

190
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,440
And here we can see the swarm plot.

191
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,000
And hopefully it's kind of more obvious how the swarm plot is essentially a combination of a strip plot

192
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,530
and a violent plot.

193
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:42,000
It shows the same distribution except it's actually showing all the points themselves.

194
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,130
One drawback to using a swarm plot even though they're pretty nifty and cool and the fact that they

195
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:52,450
show a lot of information sometimes they don't actually scale that well to very large numbers both in

196
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,660
terms of the ability to show all the points.

197
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,810
These points just go way too wide since you don't want to stack anything on top of each other.

198
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,710
And it also takes a lot of computation to begin to arrange them.

199
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,360
So I would advise not to use swarm plots for very large data sets.

200
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,530
And in fact I would say just in general probably stay away from just showing swarm plots since most

201
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:14,170
people probably haven't encountered them before.

202
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:19,240
Do quick know if you do really like the swarm plot you can actually combine it with a violent plot to

203
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,630
show both pieces of information stacked on top of each other.

204
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:31,950
You can say in this same cell will go ahead and say SNL violin plot and will copy and paste the exact

205
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:39,660
same information here into our violent plot and we'll go ahead and specify the color of the swarm plot

206
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:47,730
to be black and this is actually going to plot both right on top of each other and here you can see

207
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:54,170
every single point and the corresponding KDE or kernel density estimation plot on top of it.

208
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,200
Now there's a lot of information here so be careful of this.

209
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:03,090
This is probably more useful for presentation but just for exploratory data analysis Hopefully these

210
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:08,340
kind of plots help you just immediately understand your data but not so much on the side of explaining

211
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,640
to an executive.

212
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:16,020
Those kind of things are better done with either box plots or they sort of count plots or bar plots

213
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,310
these kind of plots these more advanced violent plots strip plots swarm plots are just more suited for

214
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,780
a data scientists themselves and had actually read in or explore your data information.

215
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:34,560
Finally I want to talk about Factor plot factor plot is actually just the most general form of all these

216
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:42,840
plots and what it does is if we do shift tab here it takes in an argument a wargame why arguments can

217
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:48,990
take human data but then it also just takes in a kind's arguments and the kind argument is essentially

218
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,350
what's going to describe the facts or plot itself.

219
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,970
For instance we can say fact or plot will say we're going to copy and paste that sequel's day why it

220
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:05,100
was total bill was to Tipps excuse me and then we can go ahead and say Kines is equal to.

221
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,190
Let's say one of the bar plot you can just say bar.

222
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,840
And it creates a bar plot based off those categories.

223
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:17,650
So all the plots we've been looking at before the most general method is called Sonesta factor plot

224
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:17,770
.

225
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,460
And then actually specify the kind.

226
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:24,900
So for instance if we wanted to recreate the violent plot you can call kind violin and this begins to

227
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,830
recreate that violent plot.

228
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:32,580
Personally I prefer to actually call the plot itself specifically so as an S that violent plot stript

229
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:38,890
plot box plot etc. versus calling the more general fact or plot method but know that this is available

230
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,680
for you in case you want to call it.

231
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,140
All right.

232
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,140
That's it for categorical plots.

233
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:50,490
Hopefully you saw a lot of the power that's available to you and use this power wisely especially depending

234
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,870
on who you're presenting to for instance like I mentioned before these box plots.

235
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:00,990
Easy to read a lot of management people understand them well these more advanced plots those are more

236
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,150
for you to explore that data.

237
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,630
OK.

238
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:09,990
Hope you enjoyed this lecture and I hope you've enjoyed seeing how easy seaborne makes these visualizations

239
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,560
for you.

240
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,670
Everything you've been doing is essentially just one line of code which is pretty awesome.

241
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,580
Okay thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture
