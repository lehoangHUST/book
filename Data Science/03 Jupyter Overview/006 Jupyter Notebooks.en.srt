00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,500
Hello everyone and welcome to the Jupiter notebook's lecture and this lecture will be showing you how

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,540
to effectively use the Jupiter notebook system and giving you a tour of the overall environment.

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,580
Also check out the resources for this lecture in order to download the zip file that contains all the

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,000
notebook files.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,150
So as I mentioned check the resources for the lecture and download the zip file.

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,700
It contains all the dot IP Y and B files or notebook files and those notebooks for the rest of the Course

7
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,430
mix.

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,910
Remember where you saved and unzipped that file.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,990
Let's go ahead and explore the notebooks as well as get a feel for how to effectively use them.

10
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,510
I'm going to go ahead and just remind you how you can open up a Jupiter notebook.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,770
I'm going to go ahead and jump to the command prompt now.

12
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,090
All right.

13
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,320
Here I am at my command prompt as a reminder if you're using Mac OS.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,710
Go ahead and just use your terminal for this.

15
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,870
If you're using Windows just go ahead and come over here and type in ACMD and select your command prompt

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,090
.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,310
There's also in an icon the command prompt you can use that as well.

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,250
That's the command prompt that comes with the Anaconda distribution.

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:11,830
All right.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,200
So you go ahead and come to the command prompt and then type in j u p y t r space notebook and hit enter

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,010
.

22
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,040
Keep in mind this is going to start a Jupiter notebook wherever you are in the command prompt.

23
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,840
So for instance I'm going to delete this real quick.

24
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:35,430
I am under C users and then my middle name here Marysia and that's where my notebook is going to get

25
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,110
started.

26
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,030
If I want to start my notebooks in another directory I need to change directory the way I can change

27
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,770
directory is by using CD and then typing in the next file that I want.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,880
So let's say I wanted to go to my downloads folder because that's where I downloaded the zip file.

29
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,110
I could start typing in D O N then you can actually tab autocomplete this and then it should take you

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,640
to.

31
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:04,260
If you go out and click enter now downloads and then I could type in DUPERE notebook enter and run this

32
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,840
and now my Jubran notebook file is going to be when I show it in my browser under the downloads folder

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,610
.

34
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,000
If you want to go ahead and go back up one folder you can type in CD.

35
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:22,090
That's change the rectory space dot dot and that will take you back up one directory.

36
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,110
You can go ahead and just look up basic command prompt lines.

37
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,860
There are a little different.

38
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,250
The penny for using Mac OS or Windows for instance if you want to see all the directory folders and

39
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,400
your current directory in Windows that's d I are the C directory.

40
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,780
And this basically shows you all the files here in your current directory.

41
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,170
If you are on Mac you can type in L S for list all of them.

42
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,320
All right then to clear everything you have here.

43
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,290
If you're on Windows you can just type in C L S.

44
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,120
If you're on a Mac and type in the word clear let me go ahead and start the Jupiter note book and when

45
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,150
to hit enter and it's going to open up a chip in a notebook in my browser.

46
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,020
Here it is.

47
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,940
I'm going to go ahead and find where I actually saved the unzips file.

48
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,510
Here it is python data science machine learning boot camp and the Pentagon unzip program you used.

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,920
You may or may not have this dasht master at the end but if you go ahead and click on this folder you'll

50
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,460
see quite a few folders here.

51
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,660
Python for data analysis for data visualization.

52
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,550
Python crash course machine learning sections data kept some projects big data and Sparc and more.

53
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,070
The very first section is under this folder.

54
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,960
Python crash course if you click on that section where that folder you'll have the notebook.

55
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,700
And here you see the dot IPY and be files.

56
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,670
So pretty much for every lecture where you see me coding something out there is a folder that has the

57
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,550
overall section name and then they'll be a subfolder of the actual section name and then the notebook

58
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,630
files which correspond to the lecturer names.

59
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,030
So the very first one is python crash course.

60
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,590
You can go ahead and click on this.

61
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,990
They'll take a little time to load.

62
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:09,270
Here it is and then everything I'll be typing out throughout the lecture is here for you and pretty

63
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,460
much at the beginning of every section of the course.

64
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:16,380
I'll remind you on where you can find the actual note books for that section of the Course answers quite

65
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,100
a few lectures and it may be hard to find it sometimes.

66
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,520
I'll be there to guide you and if you ever have any questions on where to find things just feel free

67
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,460
to post the Q&A forums and I'll be happy to help you there.

68
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,890
All right then after that we'll start Python for data analysis.

69
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,030
You'll start the number by s.c or click on PI and see it notebook's for that.

70
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,790
Let me go ahead and just walk through how the Jupiter note book system works in a general sense.

71
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:49,050
I'm going to go all the way back up to the master and then I'm going to click new and here since I have

72
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,350
kind of several environments.

73
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,110
I'm going to click this one but you can click Python or Python 3 or whatever it's good and click on

74
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,300
it should be fine.

75
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,180
Again you can just click new whatever it says in notebooks.

76
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,640
You should be fine to click on it.

77
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,040
You'll get something like this to retitle this notebook.

78
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,260
You don't just click here under the untitled section and name it whatever you want.

79
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,400
My notebook for instance click OK and I'll name it.

80
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,940
Let me go ahead and show you the basics.

81
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:21,440
This is a code cell which means I can type in Python code into the cell and then run it as a very basic

82
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,070
example I can say prints hello and then I can run the cell by clicking here on run and Ill go ahead

83
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,690
and run and show me the output below the cell.

84
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:35,150
I can also do the same thing for basically any Python code if I wanted to know what one plus one is

85
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,350
.

86
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:41,120
I just click run here and it shows me the output in the cell notice since I printed the output here

87
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,980
it didn't show out since I didn't actually specify to print the output.

88
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,780
It showed the output cell.

89
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,820
The facts he said prints one plus one.

90
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,980
Then it wouldn't show that little out.

91
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,620
OK.

92
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,170
So you don't always have to come up here and click this run cell which you can do is actually just to

93
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,580
shift enter.

94
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,290
And that's when I put it as a string shift enter.

95
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,320
And if I do shift enter it will go ahead and run whatever is in that cell.

96
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,400
So keep that in mind.

97
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:16,370
That's a really nice way to just run stuff quickly so you don't have to constantly come over here and

98
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,060
click run sell.

99
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,030
Another little trick is alt enter.

100
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,940
If I do shift and turn on this it just goes down to the next cell.

101
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:30,210
But if I do alt enter it will actually insert a cell below it as well.

102
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,240
So notice the difference here.

103
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,240
If I just do shift enter on this first cell it runs it.

104
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,340
And that is how the n changes its number to show you the order of stuff and how it's been run.

105
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,930
Then if I do enter it actually inputs a cell for me.

106
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,600
That's a really nice trick and I'll show you why later on when we discuss exercises.

107
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,980
OK.

108
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,510
Now you may be wondering how can I save this notebook.

109
00:06:53,510 --> 00:07:00,380
Can either do control s or click here on the little floppy disk save actually has an autosave feature

110
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,540
surround every two minutes auto save.

111
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,980
Or you can just say file and you can do a save and checkpoint here.

112
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,530
Now you may also be wondering how do I download this notebook as something else.

113
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,470
Well you can just go to file download as.

114
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,780
And you actually have a bunch of options here to download.

115
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,570
If you just want the dot PI file you can just say download as a dot PI and it will download and convert

116
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,810
this notebook file into a file so you can use it as a normal Python script and whatever ID you want

117
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,040
.

118
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:35,720
Or if you just want the HVM Elano you can click on each T.M. and it will export it to a basic a simple

119
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,070
file that any browser can show.

120
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,300
So you have a bunch of options.

121
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,780
You can go in and check them out.

122
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:48,130
Something else I want you to know is if you ever have for instance an infinite while loop running.

123
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,330
So let's just say this is like running forever and you want to somehow restart your kernel.

124
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,070
What will happen is under this in me zoom in a bit instead of a number here and end you'll see a low

125
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,860
Asterix.

126
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,550
It'll just be running forever.

127
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:07,880
What you can do is just go in and say kernel and then restart the kernel say do you want to restart

128
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,330
the kernel.

129
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,660
You go ahead and restart.

130
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,700
Well say restarting kernel and then I'll say kernel ready.

131
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,600
Basically what happens is this notebook is connected to a kernel and a kernel is kind of just an instance

132
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,740
of Python running.

133
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,560
And if something's wrong where Python is crashing maybe you actually wrote a script that just infinitely

134
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,300
loops or takes a really long time.

135
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,970
You can always just stop everything by coming over to kernel and clicking restart can also interrupt

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,230
if you just want to interrupt that specific cell but sometimes it doesn't work.

137
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,770
If you get a really bad while loop that runs forever just keep that in mind.

138
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,000
OK.

139
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,680
If you ever need help in addition to everything I just told you here you can always just click help

140
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,050
and then they'll give you help on a lot of the libraries.

141
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,480
We're going to be working with as well as just notebook helping click on that it will send you to a

142
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,760
link where it tells you about the notebooks themselves.

143
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,090
Keep in mind these notebooks used to be called I Python notebooks but now since Jupiter can run other

144
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,450
languages such as Juliet and are they're called the Jupiter notebooks.

145
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:12,000
Now another thing I wanted to mention is there's more keyboard shortcuts than what I just told you.

146
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,540
You can go to help click on keyboard shortcuts and it will give you a list of all the keyboard shortcuts

147
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,700
that are available to you.

148
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:20,930
All right.

149
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:25,490
That's really the basics of the notebook and pretty much all you need to know as far as you go through

150
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,250
this course.

151
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:31,460
You have any questions that are more specific to a particular topic that you can't find the help here

152
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:31,640
.

153
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,310
Go ahead and search to Kewaunee forums.

154
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,820
If you can't find that there or in the fake Q Feel free to post the new questions to the Q&A forums

155
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,850
and I'll be happy to help you out.

156
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,300
Real quick I wanted to show you what exercises look like throughout this course.

157
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,140
So for instance let's say you go a python for data analysis.

158
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:53,030
You're on the PI section of the Course you've done the lectures and you're ready to begin the exercise

159
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,410
.

160
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,410
Every exercise will have solutions file associated with it.

161
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,050
Don't check out the solutions file first.

162
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,100
You should check out this exercise file.

163
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,660
Then you can go ahead and click on the sexercise file and this one will pop up and look something like

164
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,420
this.

165
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,120
And this exercise file will have questions for you.

166
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,740
And then a cell where you can go ahead and answer those questions and a lot of times.

167
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,740
I'll also show you the expected output.

168
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,050
So for instance here you want to create an array of zeros.

169
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,460
Now I know you probably don't know how to do that yet but keep in mind that if you start typing stuff

170
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:32,210
in the cell such as prints hello and run this you'll overwrite the output.

171
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:38,020
So just keep that in mind and there will be more relevant when you actually get to the exercises.

172
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,580
Some of you may be wondering is what kind of cell is this.

173
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,490
The actually just shows text and isn't a code cell.

174
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,780
Well this is known as a markdown cell.

175
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:53,430
If we go ahead and go back to my notebook here everything I've shown you so far is a code cell.

176
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,910
But what's really awesome about Jupiter notebooks is you can type in notes for yourself in normal markdown

177
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,540
text so you can come over here look on code.

178
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,790
Click on markdown and it will convert this into a markdown cell.

179
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:14,510
And now if I run the cell it's essentially just basic text for me to type notes for myself which is

180
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,760
really useful when you're learning.

181
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,770
You can say something like.

182
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,770
Use print to print strings.

183
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:29,330
Run that little note for yourself and then you can go ahead and type in prints hello etc. and that's

184
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,850
a really nice way to kind of take notes as you go along throughout the lectures and this also supports

185
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,040
a markdown formatting.

186
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,580
So if you're familiar of markdown formatting such as how to use hash tags for bold etc..

187
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:46,040
Or maybe do a taluk with just a couple of asterisks lips.

188
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:52,220
More bullet points or indentation for a kind of code formatting that's also ported in these markdown

189
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,310
cells.

190
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:58,490
Now we won't go over marked down syntax because I can be a whole nother course but just keep in mind

191
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:03,760
if I see something like this type mark down and latex that says it's a markdown cell.

192
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:09,290
A common mistake sometimes beginners make is they'll accidently convert this to a markdown cell and

193
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,550
then wonder hey why isn't my code running.

194
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:17,390
If your code is ever not highlighted it probably means that you're only running a markdown cell.

195
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:22,640
If you want to change this markdown cell back to a code cell just come up here and select code then

196
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,120
run this with a shift enter and you're good to go.

197
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:34,250
OK so remember shift enter runs a cell and then Alt Enter will run a cell and output a cell below it

198
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:34,600
.

199
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:44,180
So if you go ahead and click alternate are here so like do again Alt Alt center and in putting a new

200
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,980
cell.

201
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,700
Now I'm just referring to what I'm actually doing on my keyboard not want to typing in a string.

202
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,900
So again one plus one shift enter it runs it one plus one alternator.

203
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,840
It keeps putting in new cells below it which is really useful for exercises.

204
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,710
So if you come back here this is exercise.

205
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,850
Notice I have this output array 1 1 1 on 1.

206
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,060
I don't want to overwrite that.

207
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:12,020
I can just click on this text or mark down cell do enter and it gives me a little cell here for a buffer

208
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,960
so I can prints whatever I want.

209
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,750
Shift enter in outputs test.

210
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,300
All right.

211
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,710
Don't worry if you didn't completely get all of that because we're going to review all this when we

212
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,840
actually get to the exercises.

213
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,020
All right.

214
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,990
That's basically all you need to know for the Jupiter note books.

215
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,820
If you have any questions feel free to post and Q&A forums.

216
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,340
You know I'll be happy to help you out.

217
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,670
Just keep in mind that the Jupiter notebook system will start wherever you were in your command prompt

218
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,810
or your terminal.

219
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:44,330
You'll need a change directory using CD if you want to run or save your notebooks in another place in

220
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,500
your computer.

221
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,440
All right thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
