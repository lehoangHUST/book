00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,990
Hello everyone else too.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,290
Part two of these chloroplast maps lecture series in part 2.

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,640
We're going to focus on international or world scale maps.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,860
Part 1 which is the last lecture we focused on USA and nationwide choropleth maps.

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,900
Now we're going to go ahead and change this up to a world international level.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,980
Let's go ahead and jump to Jupiter notebook to get started.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,280
All right.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,280
Here I am at the Jupiter notebook.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,950
Last time we left off on U.S. agricultural exports by state.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,510
Let's go ahead and move on to our next dataset which is a world GDP data set to go ahead and comment

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,980
out that last plot and say it's physical to PD read CSP.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,210
Now we're going to go ahead and open the 2014 World GDP data set and then check out the head of that

13
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,020
data.

14
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,540
We have a country name GDP in billions.

15
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,410
And then the country code.

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,910
So let's just say standardize code for international countries basically the same as the state codes

17
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,170
that we saw earlier.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,020
We're going to go ahead and use this value the GDP country as maybe a text and then the code is the

19
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,130
actual code pasan for the coral plus mapping.

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,780
Let's go ahead and start creating our data variable.

21
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:36,020
Again we call it dictionary we say type is equal to Perl Plath just like we did last time.

22
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:47,760
Go ahead and say locations and locations are going to be equal to the code column then for the z value

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:54,400
we'll go ahead and set that equal to the GDP in billions.

24
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,000
We'll go ahead and set text equal to the country column in the data frame

25
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,190
and then we'll go ahead and set color bar arguments.

26
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,610
And here we have that dictionary where we pass and the title has a key and then a string value for the

27
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:19,320
title and we'll just say GDP in billions US dollars.

28
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,260
And that is our data object.

29
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:30,590
And now for lay out variable we'll go ahead and say casting is a dictionary.

30
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:38,820
We will set the title to be equal to the string 2014 global GDP

31
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,890
and the next thing we're going to do is set Geo is equal to.

32
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:56,370
And then it's not going to be another dictionary and go and say show frame I actually put this on the

33
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:04,620
same line as show frame is equal false.

34
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:10,230
For now and the next argument we're going to say is the projection.

35
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,160
And you can reference the documentation.

36
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:20,990
But for now we'll just that the documentation projection defaults which is this America or projection

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,310
plot looks like the dictionary ready to go.

38
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:30,400
Let's go ahead and say Koro map 3 is equal to.

39
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,010
Go figure.

40
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:41,650
Data equals data passed in as a single item list and then lay out equals lay out.

41
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,870
And then we can just call plots on coral map 3.

42
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:55,200
And here we have our 2014 global GDP and you can see that scale here basically just points out the main

43
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,630
outliers which is United States China and some of them are the belt countries or larger population countries

44
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,570
in the world.

45
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,490
Now as I've mentioned quite a few times in order to do this sort of plotting on your own you're probably

46
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,690
going to have to reference the documentation or the Jupiter notebooks and I kind of want to explore

47
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,740
that reference with you.

48
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:20,100
You can go ahead and click on the link provided in the Jupiter notebook or just go to plot the l y slash

49
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,780
Python slash reference.

50
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:27,810
And here is a basically a full reference to all the arguments you can pass into all of plotless plot

51
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,090
types and you can scroll down here to the map section and click on chloroplast to get to the core plus

52
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,750
section and you can see the various arguments you can pass in here and you can check something like

53
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,780
for instance the projection we continue down here.

54
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,860
Or we can actually just search for it.

55
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:51,580
So I can search for a projection I know is in here and we can have type and here we're under chloroplasts

56
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,860
and we can go ahead and pass and maybe another projection type.

57
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:02,080
That means we can just grab one of these strings and just grab this one that's another projection type

58
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,100
.

59
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,830
I just come in here replace the string of the and then run this plot again.

60
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,350
And now I have a different projection type.

61
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,270
Notice here how the country are shaped a little differently.

62
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:19,080
You can go ahead and continue exploring these such as a stereographic projection come here.

63
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,530
Copy and paste and rerun and that's basically what you do when you're kind of playing around and exploring

64
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,160
these libraries.

65
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,600
So here's another projection you can actually kind of spin this around.

66
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,100
It's a little weird it's kind of an inverted globe feeling.

67
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,110
They can go ahead and play around these and explore them on your own.

68
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,920
One projection that's nice to look at is the natural earth projection which if you just go ahead and

69
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:51,360
pass it in here natural earth and then run this again you get basically a nice natural looking earth

70
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,690
and you can pass it and cool it and you can see the rotation here on the planet.

71
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,560
OK.

72
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,720
Go ahead and explore the documentation.

73
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,790
That's a big part of learning how to use these sort of coral plethora more complicated geographical

74
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,060
plotting libraries and capabilities of Watley.

75
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,860
Like I mentioned before quite a bit of this has to do for your data looks like if your data is not in

76
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,490
a format that plot can accept you probably have to go to use in another geographical plotting library

77
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:26,730
but hopefully you're able to convert either a country code or country name into an acceptable format

78
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,740
for Watley.

79
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,380
All right that's it for this lecture.

80
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:36,870
I hope you enjoyed it and seen the power of plotline even though it's a little hard syntax wise for

81
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,450
just a few lines of code really.

82
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,570
I mean this is just about 15 lines of code maybe even less.

83
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:49,020
You're actually able to make a very nice looking interactive visualization on a geographical international

84
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,160
scale.

85
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,160
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
