00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,440
Hello everyone and welcome to the chloroplast map's lecture and this lecture we're going to go over

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,870
how to use Python and partly to create coral maps which will allow us to plot out information either

3
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,080
on a global scale or any nation wide scale.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,170
Let's go ahead and jump to Jupiter notebook to get started.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:22,830
All right.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,360
Here I am at the Jupiter note but the Supernaut books called Kuro plus maps.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,600
And you can find under Python for data visualization under the geographical plotting folder and you

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,480
should start in the note book or work inside of this book in order to access the V data.

9
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,800
We're going to be working with again all the code we're going to be typing up as a reference here.

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,920
And also he should know that there's references for his explanations plus plots can be really difficult

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,410
at first especially the syntax used for plotless.

12
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,070
So you'll always want to keep this note book as a reference for things.

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,720
And we're going to do just go out and explain the code in this notebook see some simple examples at

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:08,620
first using just nation wide scale plots then we're going to see some real data do a larger plot on

15
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,510
nationwide scale and then we're going to go ahead and see the world scale so we can actually plot on

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,960
two countries.

17
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,100
All right let's go ahead and start a new chapter notebook.

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,190
All right here I am at a Jupiter note book I'm going to go ahead and start up with some imports.

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,730
First I'm going to import slightly dot plot Ali as he y.

20
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:38,520
And then I'm going to say in order to do all of this off line or save from plot the off line imports

21
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,610
download underscore plot Legia.

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,250
And I'm just using tabbed to autocomplete this.

23
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:51,000
So I just type in it and then it'll autocomplete in it underscored notebook mode and then plots and

24
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,180
plot.

25
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,210
So for functions to complete and you can just copy and paste this code from the notebook if you want

26
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:57,540
.

27
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:07,410
And then I'm also going to then call it underscore notebook mode and passen connected is equal to true

28
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:07,640
.

29
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:13,020
And that we can see everything inside the Jupiter notebook and there's a link in your lecture notebook

30
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,130
for other options use partly off line.

31
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,420
OK.

32
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,950
Again like I mentioned plot Lee's mapping can be a bit hard to get used to.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,160
So there's a copy of a cheat sheet as well as a link to it in the Jupiter notebook and it looks something

34
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,920
like this.

35
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,980
So you can see basic charts with partly how to use them.

36
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,050
And if you scroll down you can later on see actual maps and the cheat sheets here.

37
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,860
This is kind of the format we're going to be following.

38
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,690
Let's go ahead and jump back to the Jupiter notebook.

39
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,960
First thing we need to do is begin to build our data dictionary.

40
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,740
And the easiest way to do this is using the DCT method.

41
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,600
So you can actually cast a dictionary with the ICC.

42
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,050
So we're going to be using that method to cast the list into a dictionary and the first thing we're

43
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,130
going to do is start off with our data.

44
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:09,800
So you have your data and it's going to be a dictionary and we're going to have the key type be Coro

45
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,730
Plath.

46
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:20,190
And then we're going to have locations and locations is a list of states and it's the abbreviation for

47
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,120
the states in our case since we're doing this just on the nationwide scale.

48
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:32,040
So go in and say Asie CA and NY you can go ahead and put in any postcode abbreviations you want there

49
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,670
.

50
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,000
Then we're going to say location mode.

51
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:43,920
And in this case we're going to put in USA cash States and this lets Whitely know that we're doing this

52
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,710
on the United States level and there's various location mode and you can go ahead and check out the

53
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:55,020
links in the Jupiter notebook to get the documentation on the various location modes you can provide

54
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,460
.

55
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:05,790
Then we're going to go ahead and set the color scale to be equal to Portland which is just a color scale

56
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,670
and we can also do other things such as greens or grays and walk.

57
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,500
We'll mix this up and see how it works later on.

58
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:22,530
I'll just choose Portland and then we're going to go ahead and do is passen in key text and text is

59
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,600
a list of what hovers over each of the locations.

60
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,990
So I'm just going to put some basic stuff here.

61
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,570
We'll go in and say text one text 2 and then text 3

62
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,520
and then Z is going to be equal to your actual values that are going to be shown in a color scale.

63
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:52,870
We'll go ahead and just set these two one two and three and I'll put them in as floats.

64
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,660
And then finally pasan a color bar arguments.

65
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:10,050
And this is actually a dictionary with the key title and then you would just person Whoops you're passing

66
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,940
whatever you want the color bar title to be.

67
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:18,620
So as a very generic one I'll say color bar title goes here.

68
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,600
Right so that's what data looks like and we just take a look at data.

69
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,140
It's going to be a dictionary for whatever reason the partly documentation likes to use this sort of

70
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,980
dictionary casting call instead of just building it out as a dictionary.

71
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,710
This kind of saves you time for typing and all these quotes and now having to make all these strings

72
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,590
for keys.

73
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,380
So I'll just go ahead and keep in line with the documentation and use this sort of notation.

74
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:51,950
Next we want to do is create a layout object or variable and layout is going to go ahead and be a nested

75
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,530
dictionary.

76
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:59,350
And we just passen G.O. is equal to and then we set the scope

77
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,240
to be US A.

78
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,660
And then what we're going to go ahead and use is the go figure.

79
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:17,300
And in order to do that we're going to need to import something else will have to say import Clottey

80
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,270
dot graph underscore RBJ s as.

81
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,980
And I'm going to go ahead just put this up at the top with the other imports and run that.

82
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,980
OK so no that's important.

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,430
I can say Go figure

84
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,740
and set data.

85
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:47,030
And this is kind of the weird part equal to in brackets so as the item of the list data which is kind

86
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,610
of strange because it's already a dictionary but you pass it in as a dictionary inside of a list and

87
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:59,170
then you just say lay out is going to be equal to lay out.

88
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,430
You don't technically need to actually passen data equals and laya equals we could just pass in data

89
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,180
and lay out.

90
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:13,130
Well let's go ahead and just keep it this way and we'll set this whole thing equal to Koro map and then

91
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,750
we do say I plot Curle math.

92
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:26,990
And we should see the plot here and here we have Arizona California and New York highlighted with the

93
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,240
Portland color chart chosen here.

94
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,740
Now we can go ahead and change it to one of the predefined strings shown in your notebook.

95
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,770
For instance you can go out and change this to jet.

96
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,940
See what changes happen there.

97
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,410
Run everything again.

98
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,170
And here we have now the jet color scheme or we can do other things such as greens is another one you

99
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,180
can choose.

100
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:58,460
Run that and everything is in green So if New York being the very light green over here let me go ahead

101
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:04,340
and just break down everything we just did because the formatting can be kind of confusing and it really

102
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,270
it just takes time.

103
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,960
You usually don't actually memorize this.

104
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,500
You'll have to reference examples from the documentation or from the cheat sheet.

105
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:21,140
But the basic idea is we have our imports we initialized notebook mode and then we have two main objects

106
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:27,130
a data object and a layer object and I can call these just my variables my data variable and my layout

107
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,260
variable and the past goes into the Go figure function.

108
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,220
And then I want to pass that thing into plot.

109
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:41,090
If I just pass into plot what will happen is this will open a new tab as an h m file and you can go

110
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:47,190
ahead and save the say e-mail file or export it or you can download it as a PNB.

111
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,500
All right.

112
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,810
Well let's go ahead and go back to lecture here.

113
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,350
In our data object we have a couple of arguments we have type which clarifies what type of geographical

114
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,200
plot we're doing.

115
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,850
In this case we're focusing right now just Court plots.

116
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:08,570
Then you have locations locations is an array or a list of those actual state abbreviation codes then

117
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,410
you specify a location mode.

118
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:16,070
In this case since we're working in USA we're going to say USA Dasch States and this can go down to

119
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,300
county level.

120
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,650
You can go in and reference the documentation that's linked in the chip in a notebook.

121
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:27,910
For more information on that then you have the text and the text is an array or a list of the text that

122
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,740
lines up for each of the locations.

123
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:41,180
So for example go out and change this to Arizona change this one to Cali and change this one to New

124
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:47,510
York and if we run this again and notice that in plot let me go to him.

125
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:54,590
Let me go to specify it as I plot so he see inside that you put in a book you'll notice when I say I

126
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:59,640
plot the text value says Kalli Arizona and New York.

127
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,910
So that means that this text just has to be in the same index sequence as the locations and it's going

128
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:13,090
to match up then the z is whatever value you want to represent as a color.

129
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,450
So for instance Cali was valued to Arizona as value 1 in New York Cazayoux three.

130
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,900
Later on we'll see with real data how we can actually use this to kind of indicate certain levels by

131
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,440
state but here that's what the color bars are relating to.

132
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,630
And we can see that the title of the color bar goes here just is a title for this color bar.

133
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:37,870
And you can choose the color scale with whatever string you want that's mentioned in that Jupiter note

134
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,550
book again for this type of plotting.

135
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,840
You'll really have to reference either the documentation of the Jupiter notebook because the formatting

136
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,420
is really kind of bizarre here but that's the way plotless works.

137
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:57,240
Then you have a layout variable and a nested dictionary object where you just specify G.O. and the scope

138
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,510
to be USA.

139
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,850
It's going to be a USA states chloroplast.

140
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:08,270
And then you pass the whole thing to go that figure and you say I plot Coro map and you see this here

141
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,130
.

142
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,990
Now go ahead and show an example with some real data as well some other options we can add to the dictionaries

143
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,200
and data and layout.

144
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:23,420
So go ahead and build on the knowledge you already have going to go ahead and scroll down here and I'm

145
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:29,080
going to say DFA is equal to PD that read C S V and there's a C S V file here.

146
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:37,850
Call 2011 us underscore agri underscore exports and these are just agricultural exports by state.

147
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,740
And let me go out and ellipse import Pandurs in order to read that in.

148
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,570
And then we'll check out the head of the state A-frame.

149
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:51,090
So in the state of frame I have a code of the actual state name category in this case for all states

150
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,300
.

151
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,960
Total exports and then things such as beef pork poultry dairy etc..

152
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:01,140
So what if these states are exporting for agricultural products.

153
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,670
All right so let's go ahead and get started by creating our data variable.

154
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:12,830
In our lay out variable my data variable is going to have that dictionary casting and we'll go ahead

155
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:18,570
and say type is equal to Coro.

156
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,130
And then we pasan a color scale arguments.

157
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,820
In this case I'm going to pass in the string.

158
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:32,860
Capital Y capital I capital O lowercase our capital are lowercase D.

159
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:42,270
In this kind of a yellow orange red and the next I'm going to say locations I remember locations.

160
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:49,940
If we scroll back up here was just the list of state codes and our locations mode is also here.

161
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:56,400
Now we actually have in our data frame if we look at this a code column.

162
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,330
So I'm just going to pass A.F. code

163
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:11,240
and the next is going to be our location mode and we'll set that equal to USA states

164
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:20,090
and we also want to specify what we're going to say for z and z is going to be what the color bar is

165
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,140
actually representing this case.

166
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:28,700
Let's go ahead and say the total exports.

167
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,270
So we have total exports as a column there and that's going to be our value.

168
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,450
We also have texts and that's just going to be text that lines up.

169
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,140
And if you scroll all the way to the right it's kind of conveniently placed text column here.

170
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,100
Usually you probably have to build your own text column but since this is just an example we already

171
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,990
have a text for you.

172
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,200
We'll go ahead and passen text there

173
00:13:54,710 --> 00:14:03,240
and then we also want to passen a color bar than to say color bar is equal to.

174
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:08,290
And this is where you have that dictionary where you just have the title of the color bar.

175
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:14,210
In this case let's go in and say millions USD because that's what the actual total exports represents

176
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,480
.

177
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,840
That's the number in millions of U.S. dollars.

178
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:25,130
Now we're going to go ahead and add one more argument to this and it's going to be the marker equals

179
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,200
.

180
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:31,470
And this is kind of a weird argument because it's a set of nested dictionaries but this basically is

181
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:37,350
going to define a marker that we're going to show once we show the plot and you're going to say cast

182
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:45,590
a dictionary line is a key equals and then another dictionary casting call and you say color is equal

183
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,640
to an plotless can accept r.g B color as a weird string format.

184
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,030
You say R.G. B.

185
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,330
And then in parentheses you pass in your R.G. B values.

186
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:01,250
So let's go ahead and just say two 5:55 for all three of these for red green and blue.

187
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:08,720
And then I'm also going to specify inside of this inside inner dictionary that the width is equal to

188
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,720
two.

189
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,720
And we'll see later on how that marker actually comes into effect.

190
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,400
And then finally I want to make sure that we have a comma here.

191
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,790
So we have the next key and we close it off.

192
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,020
All right.

193
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,860
That's my data dictionary.

194
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,430
Now we're going to have our lay out dictionary.

195
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:35,510
I'm going to say lay out is equal to how my dictionary casting call I can set the title of the actual

196
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,100
plot.

197
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:49,460
Now let's go and say this is 2011 U.S. agriculture exports by states that I'm going to say Geo is equal

198
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,140
to and I going to pass in a dictionary here.

199
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,420
We have scope is equal to USA.

200
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:02,690
I'm going to pass in two additional arguments inside of this dictionary show Lakes is equal to true

201
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:09,480
and that basically just says show the actual lakes and the map and then you can choose Lake color and

202
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:15,020
I'm going to passen and R.G. be code using platies notation for our G-B code which is just a string

203
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,940
R.G. B.

204
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,250
And then in-print sees the colors are the values you want.

205
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:25,940
So we're going to say 85 173 to 40 and I grabbed these from the Internet because they basically make

206
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:31,720
a nice blue for the lakes and that's going to be our lay out dictionary so we just take a look that

207
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:37,370
we can have this weird nested dictionary structure but that's the way plotless takes it.

208
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:45,410
Then finally we can say Koro map to is equal to go figure.

209
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:53,250
Data equals and we passen that data dictionary into a list and then we just say layout equals lay out

210
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:53,810
.

211
00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:00,920
And then finally we call I plot's on coral map too.

212
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:10,460
And here we have now 2011 U.S. agricultural exports by state and notice as we hover over we get to see

213
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,400
all that text those values California.

214
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:19,170
We also see that the lakes are blue meaning that show lakes and the color of the lakes worked out correctly

215
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,470
.

216
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,890
We have a color scale.

217
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:27,230
We have our tidal Millings USD and we also see that there's kind of spacing between the states themselves

218
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,640
.

219
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,900
That is what that marker represented.

220
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,720
So if we go back here under data we had this marker.

221
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:41,690
So we set a line for color and then with so if we increase this with the line by let's say double and

222
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,700
let's go in and change the color to be something like 12 12 12.

223
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,610
So it's really obvious.

224
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:55,090
I'll run this again and then notice how this map is going to change as far as these borders are right

225
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:55,390
now.

226
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:01,790
Very thick black borders site changed those are G-B values and you can do that just by following this

227
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,340
kind of formula here saying dictionary line and then dictionary again you choose the color and the width

228
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,480
of the dictionary.

229
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,260
Well go ahead and just set this back to something like one.

230
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,110
And if I run this again we can see our plot.

231
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,790
All right.

232
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:23,600
That's how you can create Curle plus plots on a U.S. national scale using plot line.

233
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,390
Now I shouldn't know.

234
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:31,140
It is pretty confusing as far as the syntax and trying to remember what order everything goes into.

235
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:36,020
My best advice to give you is to reference a Jupiter notebook and to reference the documentation links

236
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,430
in the Jupiter notebook.

237
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:42,200
More often than not you'll just have to essentially copy and paste and then fill in the relevant code

238
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,680
for your particular data set.

239
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,410
It's not easy but that's the way you have to do it.

240
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,610
And this is just by nature geographical plotting is pretty tricky because it can come in so many formats

241
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:59,280
that they try to make it vague so you can pass in as many possible locations or location modes.

242
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,900
But that just leads to kind of weird syntax structure.

243
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,750
That's the nature of this game of geographical plotting as far as trying to use plot Lee as a Python

244
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,480
library for geographical plotting.

245
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,470
But you can see after all that hard work you do get something that is quite nice to show other people

246
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,030
.

247
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,520
All right.

248
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:23,340
Coming up in the next lecture will show how to do this on a global scale with global coral plus plots

249
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:23,930
.

250
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,370
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
