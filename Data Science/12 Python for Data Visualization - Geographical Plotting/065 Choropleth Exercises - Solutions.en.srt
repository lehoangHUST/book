00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,350
Hello everyone and welcome to the Karplus maps exercises solution's lecture in this lecture.

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,140
We're going to be coding up solutions for the exercises on the Karplus maps section.

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,260
Let's go ahead and chump's that you put a notebook to get started.

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,470
All right.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,500
Here I am at the Jupiter notebook.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,850
I want to go ahead and run the plotline imports despite running shift enter there and then the first

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:33,420
thing we want to do is import pandas as PD and then we're going to go ahead and use pandas to read the

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,830
CXXVI 2014 underscore world power consumption.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:47,570
So I'm going to go and say the sequel to PD read CXXVI and then passen 2014.

10
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:54,420
Or I can actually just use to find fine and complete this and let's go ahead and check the head of the

11
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,130
data frame the head.

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,590
And here we have it.

13
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,070
OK.

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,460
Now we want to reference electional to create a core plot of the power consumption for countries using

15
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,150
the data and layout dictionary.

16
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,990
Let's go ahead and start off with the data dictionary.

17
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:20,540
When they call the casting dictionary and then I'm going to say tie is equal to chloroplast as we've

18
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,120
done before.

19
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:30,960
The next key I'm going to go an answer is locations and that's going to go ahead and be equal to the

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,400
column of the location codes.

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,520
In this case it's just country here.

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,410
So I'm just going to pass in a country

23
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,570
and then I'm going to say location mode and here's where you had a reference that documentation to figure

24
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,460
out the location mode is country space names.

25
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,600
And there's a full length to the documentation right here.

26
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,710
You can go ahead and click that link.

27
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,810
It'll take you to the full documentation reference and you can look up what is the correct location

28
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,790
mode for the specific country.

29
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,080
Since we don't actually have the country codes in this case we have the country names and hopefully

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,060
by looking up in the documentation you are able to discover that or just by referencing these solutions

31
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,710
.

32
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:19,290
Next up we want to specify z and z is going to be equal to the if and we want it to be the power consumption

33
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:19,950
column.

34
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,590
That's what we actually want our coloring to represent.

35
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:34,770
So you can go ahead and say power consumption and it's going to be let's say W H there and then the

36
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,860
text is going to go ahead and have that the the country name as well.

37
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:46,980
So going on to say text is country and then finally we'll label our color bar to be the dictionary or

38
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:54,270
a title and the color bar label is just going to be or the title color bar going to be power consumption

39
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,180
KWH.

40
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,410
Right.

41
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,200
And that's our basic data dictionary we're going to come back to it and add a couple more arguments

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,550
later on.

43
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,450
But then let's also do our layouts.

44
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,870
So I'm going to say lay out a dictionary.

45
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:18,300
So the title of this to be just the title of the plot will go on and say 2014 power consumption as the

46
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,020
title.

47
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:27,150
And then next screen you set up a geo key and then pasan a dictionary call say show frame a sequel to

48
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,440
false and then say projection.

49
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,400
And you can pass in any projection you want as was shown in the earlier lectures.

50
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,420
But let's just go ahead and stick with this.

51
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,850
For direction.

52
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,650
And now let's go ahead and run the lasso and see what we get up.

53
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,090
All right.

54
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,940
And here you can see the 2014 power consumption of the world and we can see that China and USA have

55
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,360
the highest power consumption now and the solution is NOT book.

56
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:06,090
I went ahead and changed the color scale by saying as an argument in the data dictionary I said color

57
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,890
scale is equal to this.

58
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:18,000
And then I also said reverse scale is equal to true.

59
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,660
And that just makes this color scale a little nicer.

60
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,790
You don't have to do this is kind of optional but I prefer the sort of color scale it makes a little

61
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,800
more obvious between the countries instead of having them all grayed out.

62
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,530
All right.

63
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,700
That was the way it's make the 2014 power consumption plot.

64
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,720
And again a lot of this was having to look stuff up in the documentation which I know can be tricky

65
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,390
and annoying at times but for such strange syntax choices as far as plotting the stuff out you're really

66
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,780
going to have to do that when you want to create these plots.

67
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,320
It's going to be difficult to try to call these things directly from your memory.

68
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,720
All right now go ahead and move on to the USA choral clef.

69
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,940
We want to do is import the 2012 election data.

70
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,630
I'm going to go out and use panelist to do that.

71
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,990
I'll say USDA is equal to PD.

72
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:11,050
Read CXXVI and then we're going to look at the 2012 election data.

73
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,510
I mean just using tab to autocomplete that.

74
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,850
And then I'm going to just check the head of that data frame by saying us the Fed.

75
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,740
And here we get the matching data frame.

76
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,930
Now let's go in and create a plot that displays the voting age population per state.

77
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:35,050
The AP going to make my data dictionary by saying data equals dicks and then all say type is Curle plus

78
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,550
.

79
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,440
And let's go ahead and add in those color scale arguments so I'll go in and say a color scale is equal

80
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:51,180
to this and also a reverse scale to be true.

81
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,940
And the reason I say reverse scale equal to true is so that it actually reverses the color scale.

82
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:03,400
Let me go to show you just real quick what happens if we don't put that in by say reverse scale let's

83
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,820
say equals false here which is the default.

84
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:12,370
Then I get a scale that looks like this which isn't really as nice as having the reverse so you can

85
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,030
reverse any color scale you want just by adding in that parameter.

86
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,200
And for this it usually works much better if you actually say reverse scale is true.

87
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:28,860
So this is what it looks like by default so not reversed but I prefer the darker colors to be the higher

88
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,660
quantity.

89
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,580
That way it's a little more clear.

90
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,140
All right.

91
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,910
Continuing on if we jump back here we'll go out and say reverse scale's equals true locations.

92
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:47,290
It's going to be equal to the state abbreviation which if we actually look at this here we have both

93
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,340
the state name and the state abbreviation at the end.

94
00:06:51,610 --> 00:07:04,190
Let's go ahead use state abbreviation we'll say USCF Hassen the state's abbreviation column.

95
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,400
Next we want to choose or Z and this was already told to you what you should choose.

96
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,260
It was the voting age population.

97
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,500
The AP and then location mode.

98
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,210
It's going to be called two.

99
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,410
Just like in the examples USA states just like in the lecture and then our text.

100
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:33,490
Let's go ahead and just choose the text to be the actual state name so USCF States and then we're going

101
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,430
to go ahead and do it say color bar

102
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,230
is equal to and then we pass in a dictionary here.

103
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:50,370
Title and this is going to just be voting age population.

104
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,850
Let's run that.

105
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,340
All right we have a data dictionary.

106
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,880
Now it's time to make our lay out dictionary.

107
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,100
We pass in our casting dictionary.

108
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:07,930
We set the title of our entire plot here we'll just call it 2012 election data.

109
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,900
You can call it whatever you want.

110
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,110
We'll say Geo's equal to dictionary.

111
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,500
Cisco USA.

112
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:22,180
Another argument we're going to say is show Lakes equals true.

113
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,640
And then we just choose the lake color and I want to do the late color with the RSGB mechanism we saw

114
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,810
in the lectures where partly accepts a string.

115
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,650
It's kind of in a strange format these say R.G. B.

116
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:41,700
And then you actually pass in the numerical values and choose these numbers 85 173 and 240 which gets

117
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,610
us a nice blue hue for the Lakes.

118
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,190
All right.

119
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,050
That's our lay out.

120
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,140
Let's going to run this.

121
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:54,480
And here we see 2012 election data and it makes sense that the most populous states such as California

122
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,430
Texas and New York and Florida have the darker colors because they have the highest population meaning

123
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,460
they have probably also the highest voting age population.

124
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:03,880
All right.

125
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,570
That's it for the coral maps exercises.

126
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:13,360
It was just this USA election data and this international power consumption data hopefully has seen

127
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,120
the power of plotline in being able to reproduce the sort of pretty advanced plots.

128
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,650
And with just a few lines of code that comes at the cost of the syntax being a little strange and having

129
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:31,650
to reference documentation but having a plot that looks this nice and being able to interact with it

130
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:37,710
and zoom in and check up the numbers and set text to what you want for having hover over it's pretty

131
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,110
nice.

132
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,540
Given how much code you're actually writing in other languages this would take much much more code.

133
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,170
All right.

134
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,630
Hope you enjoy those core Pluff maps exercises they are meant to be very challenging and having to reference

135
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,780
a lot of the documentation in order to fully understand it.

136
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,460
But that's also kind of just a real world example of what you can do when doing these things on your

137
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,190
own.

138
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,400
But you enjoyed it.

139
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,160
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
