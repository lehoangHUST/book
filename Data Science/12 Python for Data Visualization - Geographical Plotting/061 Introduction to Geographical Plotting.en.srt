Hello everyone and welcome to an introduction to geographical plodding lecture in this lecture.

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:18,300
Briefly describe our approach to geographical plodding for this course by its nature geographical plotting

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,340
is usually very challenging due to the various formats the data can come in and a lot of times you have

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,700
to find a specific library to work with for your specific data source for this course we're going to

5
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,680
focus on using plot leave for plotting.

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,430
Since you've worked with it in the past that I should also note that Matt lib also has a base map extension

7
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,500
which allows you to create static geographical plots using Map plot lit.

8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,230
We're going to focus on plot Lee due to its interactive visualization capabilities.

9
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:48,760
All right.

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,640
So let's go ahead and get started with geographical plotting by learning how to use plotline to create

11
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,800
these complex plots.

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,400
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
