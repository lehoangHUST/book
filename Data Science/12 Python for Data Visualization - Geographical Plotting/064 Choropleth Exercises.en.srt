00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,290
Hello everyone and welcome to the coral Plath's maps exercises lecture and this lecture we're going

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,020
to briefly go over the notebook for the choral Plath's maps exercise.

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,900
Let's go ahead and Jump's that you put a notebook now.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,540
All right here we are at the coral Pless maps exercise notebook.

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,410
In this exercise we're going to give you some rather simple datasets and to create correlate maps from

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,670
them using the plot the library.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,580
Now unfortunately due to the nature of slightly the fact that there HCM elf files you can't actually

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:38,940
see the example display output here centrally is just going to look like a blank output for both the

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,640
global map on the world scale and also the USA chloroplast map.

10
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,580
There's just going to be essentially blank outputs so you can actually compare unless you run the solutions

11
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:48,620
.

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,190
No but what it should look like.

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,190
But the data sets themselves are relatively simple enough.

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,460
They should have an idea of what you want to output your imports are already set up for as far as your

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,720
plotless imports you're going to go ahead and import pandas and read the CAC file.

16
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,190
Your first one is going to be 2014 world power consumption you're going to go out and check the head

17
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,190
of the data frame it should look like this.

18
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,240
And then using the lecture notes and using the documentation which you're going to go ahead and do is

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,120
create a core uplift plot of the power consumption for countries using a data and lay out dictionary

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,770
and then you should be able to essentially run these two lines of code like we did in the lectures.

21
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,100
And basically the only thing you have to do is set up data and lay out correctly.

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,630
Now that's the hardest part.

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,320
And as we've said before the syntax is pretty strange.

24
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,200
So I don't expect you to be able to do this off the top your head at all.

25
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,330
What you should be doing is referencing the documentation and the lecture and then filling in the blanks

26
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:49,010
to actually map this data to a coral clef map of the world's power consumption.

27
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,110
Then once you're done with that you're going to go and import some election data from 2012 as a CSP

28
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,570
file using Pandurs.

29
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,550
You'll go ahead and check the head of the data frame.

30
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,680
They'll look like this has a little bit more information but you're going to go ahead and do is create

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,540
a plot that displays the voting age population or a P per state.

32
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,480
And if you scroll over to the right here.

33
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,060
Here it is.

34
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,260
Voting age population V.I.P.

35
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,890
Note that this is a float.

36
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,400
So it's already been converted from a string.

37
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,580
So these other columns are actually strings but this one is already converted to a float for you so

38
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,780
it should work fine.

39
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,960
And it actually mentions this here a few later want to clear out the other columns.

40
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,820
Make sure you consider their data type and they've already been transformed for you.

41
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,240
You're going to go ahead and just set up data and lay out dictionaries and then hopefully run this line

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,670
and be able to plot this.

43
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,800
Again this is more of an exercise of you being able to take what you already know and documentation

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,920
and references that you've already seen and fill in your data to that sort of documentation and formatting

45
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,180
.

46
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,530
This is not an exercise in having everything memorized and being able to create a data and lay out dictionary

47
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,730
from scratch.

48
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,620
Really that's just unrealistic.

49
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,670
And you'll have to usually reference the documentation for these sort of plots.

50
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,310
All right.

51
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,880
Hope you enjoy the exercise should be pretty straightforward.

52
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,080
Remember to just reference to lecture notebooks and if you ever get stuck you can also reference the

53
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,220
solutions lecture.

54
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,270
Coming up next.

55
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,400
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
