Hello everyone and welcome to the Python crash course lecture series in this series of lectures.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,790
We're going to be give me a crash course into the Python programming language.

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,480
Keep in mind this will just be a general overview of Python programming.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,700
It's not meant to be an in-depth study of the entire programming language and that this course overall

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,980
is meant for people with some programming experience either in Python or more experience in another

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,900
language.

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,770
If you're completely new to programming this course may be too advanced for you if you already have

8
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,880
quite some experience.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,070
You can feel free to just skip the lecture series and go to the end where we have a python crash course

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,110
exercise to check your understanding.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,320
The topics are going to be covering are the various data types such as number strings.

12
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,360
How to print format strings list dictionaries booleans and then tuples and sets and then we're going

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,680
to have some more programming topics of Python such as comparison operators.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:05,190
If LFN else statements to do for loops and while loops of Python range list comprehension and then how

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,660
to do functions lambda expressions and use map and filter all with Python and at the end will also show

16
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,370
some extra methods you can use with the Python programming language that you're already familiar for

17
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,670
these topics of Python.

18
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,730
You can go ahead and just feel free to skip to the end.

19
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,760
OK let's go ahead and jump straight to Jupiter notebook in the next lecture.

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,940
To get started I'll see at the next lecture
