00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,100
Hello everyone and welcome to the optional final part of the finance project solutions lecture series

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,480
.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,100
In this final part which is optional we're going to go over some of the plotlines and cufflinks visualizations

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,780
specifically designed for financial data.

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,070
Let's go out and jump to the Jupiter notebook to get started.

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,260
OK here I am at the Jupiter notebook.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,660
Last time we left off at creating a cluster map using seaborne and I wanted to show you how you can

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,780
create a heat map using Clottey.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,000
You can actually just go out and grab this data rate here.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:45,560
Correlation data frame to this cell and let's go out and save this as close underscore core.

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,920
And then we're going to go in and do take a look at closing or square core.

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,740
Make sure we have the correct data frame.

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:58,440
Looks like we do it in the matrix form and then we can just call I plot off of this and specify the

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,520
kinds to be heat map and you will get a heat map that looks like this.

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,520
Now this color scale actually isn't very useful.

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,730
So you can go ahead and put in a another color scale with the color scale arguments and probably the

17
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:20,920
one that's most useful is the red for R D yellow y l blue.

18
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:28,350
B you and you can reference the plotted documentation if you want more color scale options.

19
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:33,210
You can check out the color scale it's a little better it goes from 0 to 1 as far as the correlation

20
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:33,240
.

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,310
This is interactive now.

22
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,470
Now I still prefer see Bourne's own visualization to this but I wanted you to be aware of the plot options

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,980
using the cufflinks library.

24
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,550
All right moving along.

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,810
Let's go ahead and get to the specific financial capabilities of cufflinks and plotline.

26
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,840
So you can go ahead and create a candle plots of stock using plot line and let me go in and show you

27
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,810
hey we can do this.

28
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,550
First thing we need is to grab Bank of America stock.

29
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,620
I'll just do that with the b c if we take a look at the state of frame remember we have open high low

30
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:14,640
close and we need it in a specific order to use I plot in the fashion we're going to use it in.

31
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,560
So I'm going to just grab open

32
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,130
high low and then the close call.

33
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,660
We don't want the actual volume.

34
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,230
And then I just want the values for 2015.

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:43,390
I mean is of any use I-X 2015 January 1st to 2016 looks as a string 2016.

36
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,420
And let's go to and say January 1st.

37
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:53,070
So all the values for 2015 I'll save this as BAC 15.

38
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:01,380
And then the next line I'm going to go ahead and say c 15 thought I plot and I'm actually going to specify

39
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,060
something in this.

40
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:07,660
I plot arguments I'm going to say kind is equal to Kandel.

41
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,260
And then you'll actually be able to create a candlestick plot using a plot.

42
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,880
Now if you're not aware of what a candlestick plot is it's for financial analysis.

43
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,520
It basically tells you whether or not the stock went up or down that day based off the color so green

44
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:30,360
is increasing red is decreasing and then it kind of tells you the opening high and the closing price

45
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,640
here.

46
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,240
This information you can go ahead and look up on Wikipedia.

47
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,890
Candlestick plots in if you want more information.

48
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,150
I to actually read these but this is more just for financial analysis so basically tells you the open

49
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,640
high low close and whether the stock went up or down that day.

50
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,220
All right.

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:55,430
Let's go ahead and check out the next plot which is SMK and it's basically just a simple moving averages

52
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,270
plot.

53
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,440
The plot can also create kind of automatically for you.

54
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,220
We're going to go ahead and do this for the Morgan Stanley stock.

55
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,180
So I'm going to go ahead and grab the close column of the Morgan Stanley stock.

56
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:14,330
I just want to do this for the year 2015 so I'll specify same dates.

57
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,020
I did up here.

58
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,200
Let's go and grab those

59
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:28,690
come down here take the slice chips from 2015 and then I will call a t a underscore plot.

60
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:35,430
And this is the technical analysis plot capabilities of cufflinks and then I'm going to go to say study

61
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:46,050
is SMK unspecified periods to be a couple of periods we'll go in and say 13 21 and 55 which are kind

62
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,910
of some common technical analysis periods.

63
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,480
And here we can see the simple moving averages and I plot kind of reports them as you move along which

64
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:00,170
is quite nice and you can zoom in and see some more information if you want.

65
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,820
All right.

66
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,390
Let's go ahead and move on to this one more right here.

67
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,700
Last one which is the Bollinger Band plot for Bank of America.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,880
And again this is just another technical analysis you can do which kind of shows the standard deviation

69
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,020
of the stock price as it moves out through time.

70
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,180
But again I just want this for the year 2015.

71
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:28,590
Go ahead and copy and paste same slice and do t.a underscore plot for technical analysis plot and the

72
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,360
study we're going to do is equal to the string B O L L.

73
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,900
Now we look at this we can see the upper and lower bands as we move along as well as a simple moving

74
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,530
average and then the actual closing price which is in orange.

75
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,590
OK.

76
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,560
There's definitely a lot more specific finance topics out here.

77
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,670
So don't worry if you don't understand everything we just went over.

78
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,840
The only thing you should be really concerned about is what I did with panderers and some of the basic

79
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,420
visualization operations throughout the lecture.

80
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,610
So don't worry if you don't understand all these specific technical analysis plots these are only really

81
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,990
references for people that are already familiar with this topic since this isn't a financial analysis

82
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,690
class.

83
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:16,260
This is just basically a data science class and financial analysis is its own field of study.

84
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,780
All right.

85
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,810
Hope you found this interesting if you're into this sort of analysis and I will see you at the next

86
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,710
lecture.

87
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,720
Thanks everyone.
