Hello everyone else to the data to capstone finance project overview lecture.

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,370
In this lecture we're going to go over the finance project Jupiter notebook.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,710
Let's go ahead and go to that notebook to get started.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,620
OK here we are at the finance project notebook.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,940
This notebook is located under the Data capstone projects folder.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,790
And a quick note about the finance data project in this project we're going to be focusing on exploratory

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:35,340
data analysis of stock prices and keep in mind this project is only meant to practice visualisations

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,960
and panda skills.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,140
Not meant to be a financial analysis or to be taken as any sort of financial advice.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,600
And another no this project is actually extremely challenging.

11
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,030
It's going to try to introduce you to a lot of new concepts.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,430
So you may have to look things up on your own.

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,690
There are lots of links that documentation's are going to point you in the right direction to try to

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,220
solve the tasks issue.

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,840
But you can also feel free to just walk through the solutions lecture notebook and video as sort of

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,290
a walk through Project.

17
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,030
If you don't really want to have to look things up yourself you're still going to learn a lot that way

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:06,470
.

19
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,030
Or if you're really not interested in stocks or financial analysis you can just skip this project altogether

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,900
.

21
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,580
We're going to be doing this project is focusing on bank stocks and see how they progress through the

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,340
financial crisis all the way to early 2016 and we'll show you how to get the data.

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,350
A lot of these imports are filled out for you but no you'll need to install Pandavas data reader for

24
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,040
this to work.

25
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,840
You can go out and click here for some installation instructions but basically you're just going to

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,320
have to either install or install Pancho's dash data reader so you can say Pipp install panderers dash

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,800
data reader or Konda install Pandurs stashed data reader.

28
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,310
OK so you can go ahead and use those links for install guidance.

29
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,140
Basically just I would recommend just Pipp install panelist dash reader or you can actually fall along

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,750
with the solutions video lecture.

31
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,370
But we have some imports filled out for you and you're going to get the data and you're actually going

32
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,470
to get the data directly with pandas from the Internet and there is a documentation page to give you

33
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,650
hints and instructions on how to do that.

34
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,800
And again since this is a data capstone project it's a little more vague on how to actually get that

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,660
data doesn't tell you step by step.

36
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,990
But the documentation pages should be pretty clear in how to get it.

37
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,330
Again you can go ahead and reference the solutions in case you get stuck on this step.

38
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,670
Then you just go ahead and follow the instructions and try to create similar data frames.

39
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,690
So what's shown.

40
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,930
We'll do some exploratory data analysis.

41
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,270
Check out some returns some correlations between the stocks do some visualizations and then later on

42
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:39,240
we're going to go ahead and just visualize the stocks and how they did during certain instances like

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,940
the 2008 2009 economic crash.

44
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,970
All right that's it for this overview lecture.

45
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,570
You can go ahead and check out the Jupiter note book yourself.

46
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,620
And like I mentioned if you're finding it too hard or too tough because this is an extremely challenging

47
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,390
project.

48
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,080
Feel free to just go through the solutions and experience it that way.

49
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,520
As more of a walk through Project or skip it completely.

50
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,160
If this topic just doesn't interest you at all.

51
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,940
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
