Hello everyone and welcome to the data capstone project overview lecture and this lecture we're going

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,300
to be going over the new book Thirty nine on one called the capstone project.

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,580
Let's go ahead and jump to the Jupiter notebook to get started.

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,920
All right so here I am at the notebook this notebook is located under the Data capstone projects folder

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,400
.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,840
And for this capstone project we're going to be analyzing some 911 call data from Kaggle dot com.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,600
And if you go in and click on this link it will take you to the source of that data set right here.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,190
Kaggle it's actually already downloaded as a CAC file for you so having to download anything.

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,780
But just as a quick overview background of where this data comes from comes from Kaggle dot com and

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,460
Kaggle if you click here on datasets takes you to this link and it's basically a place where you can

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,570
post data sets.

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,010
There's also a machine learning competition aspect to this Web site which we'll touch upon when we talk

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,420
about the machine learning section of this course.

14
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,050
But for now you can think of it as just a place where people can post data sets.

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:07,170
All right so these 911 calls come from Montgomery County in Pennsylvania and they contain the following

16
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:13,380
fields latitude longitude of where the call took place a description of the emergency call the Zip Code

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,210
Title a time stamp.

18
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,510
But notice it's a string not an actual date time object.

19
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,920
And then a township has a string and an address string and then that very last column E.

20
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,080
It's just a dummy variable it's always one.

21
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,850
So you can pretty much ignore that column completely and then you're going to go along with this notebook

22
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,910
and try to complete the instructions as best you can and you can always post-acute.

23
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,520
If you get stuck or you can actually just reference a solution note book or a video lecture which comes

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,400
up next you'll just go along import that data get everything set up explore the data a little bit through

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,280
some questions create new features from the data do a little bit of visualizations of bar plots do some

26
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,820
linear visualizations and then you'll actually also create some heat maps.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,620
All right.

28
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,240
That's it for this lecture.

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,980
Best of luck on the capstone project.

30
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,820
I hope you enjoy it.

31
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,880
It's quite interesting.

32
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,740
And I will see you at the next lecture where we go through the solutions step by step.

33
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,620
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
