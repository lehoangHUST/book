Hello and welcome to the introduction to this lecture and this lecture we're going to briefly discuss

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,140
what pandas is how to get it installed onto your computer and what to expect throughout this section

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,940
of the course.

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,810
Pandas is an open source library that's built on top of empire which is why we learned but PI first

5
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,270
.

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,490
Panthers allows for fast analysis and data cleaning and preparation.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,350
A lot of people like to call pandas pythons version of Excel or if you're familiar with our Python's

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,670
version of our data frames fun and pandas really excels in performance and productivity for the user

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:40,920
.

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,960
And this also has built in data visualization features which we'll learn about once he gets a python

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,670
for data visualization Pandurs can also work with data from a wide variety of sources.

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,080
You'll need to install Pandurs by going to your command line or terminal and then use either Konda install

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,680
pandas.

14
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,750
If you have the Anaconda distribution of Python or if you installed Python through a different method

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,680
you can also use Pipp install pandas.

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Either one should work for you.

17
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,910
As far as what to expect throughout this section of course we'll first discuss series and how they interact

18
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:15,890
with pandas.

19
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,430
Then we'll build on top of that to go to data frames with pandas.

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,720
Then we'll discuss some particular topics such as work of missing data how to use GROUP BY of pandas

21
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:31,140
merging joining in cannonading data frames of pandas various pandas operations and then how to get data

22
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:38,340
in and out of pandas for a wide variety of forms such as CSB files Excel files sequel and more.

23
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,300
All right let's go ahead and get started with pandas.

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,540
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
