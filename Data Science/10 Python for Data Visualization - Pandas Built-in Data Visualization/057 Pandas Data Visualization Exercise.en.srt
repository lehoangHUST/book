Hello everyone and welcome to the panels.

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,580
BILTON data visualization exercise overview lecture this lecture.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,440
We're going to get a quick overview of the exercise for the pandas built in data this section of this

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,050
course.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,060
Let's go ahead and jump to Jupiter notebook get started.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,340
All right.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,160
Here I am at the exercise notebook and basically a quick exercise for you to review the various plots

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,280
that we showed in the previous lecture and what I want you to do is actually use F 3 as the C as B file

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,980
source for the data frame.

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,440
And this is actually already kind of laid out for you in the very beginning.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,020
Are you going to go ahead and read do throughout this exercise try to recreate the plots that are shown

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,030
in the notebook something to take note of.

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:52,440
You probably want to inserts cells instead of overwriting the actual cell above the plot.

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,000
Otherwise if you run something and don't get the right result you won't be able to see that plot again

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,140
.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:04,200
So he can do is just go ahead and for instance click on this markdown instruction and then say insert

17
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,120
cell below and here you have an extra cell.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,990
The other way to do this automatically is by saying alt enter and that will also insert a cell below

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,410
it.

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,090
OK.

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,420
That way you don't have to type in the cell and accidently overwrite this figure.

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,160
Thanks everyone.

23
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,310
I'll see at the next lecture when we go over the solutions to this exercise
