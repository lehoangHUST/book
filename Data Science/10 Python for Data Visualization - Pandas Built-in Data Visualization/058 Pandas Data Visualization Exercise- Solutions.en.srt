Hello everyone and welcome to the Panthers state of visualization exercise solutions lecture this lecture

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:10,830
.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,630
We're going to go over the solutions for the pand the state of his life.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,220
Exercise questions.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,050
Let's go ahead and jump to Jupiter notebook to get started.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,810
All right here I am at the notebook.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:27,330
I'm going to go ahead and run the first few cells of code to read the D3 CACP file set up all the imports

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,500
correctly and check out the head.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,170
All right.

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,790
Next thing I wanted to do was to recreate a scatterplot of B versus a.

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,380
So just those two columns.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:46,770
Let's go ahead and do that by saying D-3 dot plot thoughts scatter and then I'm going to go in and specify

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,970
that I want on my x axis the A column and on my y axis I want the B column.

14
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,810
Let's just see what that looks like.

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,700
And this should be the EF 3.

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,610
There we go.

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,220
So I'm getting a similar plot except something to know was.

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,410
See if you can figure out how to stretch it in a similar fashion to this plot.

19
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:13,680
And as we went over in the lecture you can actually just passen fig size directly into this argument

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,680
as a parameter.

21
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,950
And we can stretch it out.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,030
So and then another thing to note here is that the size of these points is a little bigger.

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,090
So you can actually specify that as we saw in the lecture either by another column or just by passing

24
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,540
in S for size.

25
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,220
And I'm going to specify the size to be 50.

26
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:38,970
Here we have the points are a little larger and for the color it was c we saw in the lecture how we

27
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,800
can specify color by another column.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,810
But you can also just pass on a string as you could for map plot lib and here now we have a recreation

29
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,680
of that plot.

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,170
Exactly.

31
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,850
OK.

32
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,060
The main thing I wanted you to get out of this particular question was just the step of plot that scatter

33
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,940
a Versus be so x and y.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,840
Don't worry too much.

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,260
If you were able to get the sizing or the coloring size Hopefully you are able to get that.

36
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,150
OK moving on now I want to create a histogram of the A column.

37
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,880
This is actually quite simple.

38
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:21,350
Just call the column itself and then say either just to see the histogram or you can also say plot dot

39
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,560
hissed and all return the same histogram.

40
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,470
And this is the default number of bins.

41
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,890
But you can also pass in an argument if you want it more Beenz.

42
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,990
All right the next issue was that these plots are OK but they don't look very polished and the instructions

43
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:42,720
said use style sheets to set the style to G-G plot and redo the histogram from above and also figure

44
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,630
out how to add more bits to it.

45
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,690
This is a topic that we actually didn't cover in the video lecture but it is covered in the note book

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,250
so hopefully had either two paths one you recheck the notebook to figure out what style sheets was referring

47
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,430
to or you google search map Cutlip stylesheets.

48
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,770
If not you could have also posted to the Q and A forum to get to what I was referencing there.

49
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,320
If you go ahead and check out the note book lecture for pandas built in data visualization there is

50
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,240
a stylesheet section and this is kind of just to get you in the mood of trying to discover aspects on

51
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,230
your own.

52
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,590
Here you can see that map Cutlip has a stylesheets and there's a little reference link there.

53
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,330
And if you google search this you probably would have also gone to this page.

54
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:30,150
And this is the gallery and there's a sheet section in the gallery and the basic premise or idea is

55
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,290
that you can use Piel t that style.

56
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:39,030
Use pass any string of a style and it will automatically change the aesthetics to a particular style

57
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,710
that looks like this.

58
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,510
You just say peel T-Dog style that use G-G plot.

59
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,910
So I'm going to just copy this line of code.

60
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,130
Come over here and paste it.

61
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,330
And now since this has been run you'll notice that if we go ahead and copy and paste the exact line

62
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:03,240
of code here and pasted in here we get a much better looking plot.

63
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,310
And you'll also notice that here this red is a little more see through.

64
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,140
So you can also pasand Alpha to make it a little more transparent.

65
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,190
And here you can begin to start matching these histograms together.

66
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,810
Hopefully that wasn't too challenging for you but there is that aspect of kind of discovering things

67
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,490
on your own which is probably the most important part of learning data science and learning programming

68
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:26,850
.

69
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:32,280
The ability to search for an answer on your own without being given the full context of information

70
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,620
however you can always feel free to post on the Q&A forums if anything's ever confusing to you.

71
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,800
All right let's go ahead and move on to the box plots we wanted to create a box plot comparing the A

72
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,730
and B columns.

73
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,520
We take a look at what's the on that we take a look at just the data frame itself.

74
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:58,630
Notice we have a b c and d columns so I don't want to get a box plot all the columns I just want a B

75
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,080
.

76
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,800
So I'm actually just going to grab those columns by passing in a list of those column names A and B

77
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,550
and then I can call plot box.

78
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,110
Create a box plot that looks the same as this one.

79
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,580
OK.

80
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,100
Next I want to create a k d plot of the D column.

81
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,080
That's actually pretty straightforward.

82
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:26,700
You just pass in the D column say plot and then say Katie and they'll return this plot.

83
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,140
And then finally we have a we're here to figure out how to increase the line with and make the line

84
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,240
styled dash and no you would usually not Daschle K the plotline.

85
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,770
All right.

86
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:46,230
So the way you can do this is actually just take this same plot KDE or density and then you can go ahead

87
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:53,540
and passen arguments from that plot lib such as line style and line with.

88
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,840
And here we get the same plot.

89
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,310
And you can also do this with density if you want to.

90
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,620
That's the same command that we want to create an area plot of all the columns for just the rooms up

91
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,750
to 30 and then it said Hintz use x.

92
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:17,320
So hopefully you can discover by calling X D-3 I X you can see that this is a property and it's a primarily

93
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,930
a label location based in indexer with integer position fallback.

94
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,970
And so what we can do is actually just use this for slicing.

95
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,660
And again it's kind of a thing I want you to discover as you go along on your own so you can pass zero

96
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:37,610
through 30 here and this will return just the first 30 rows or whatever is slicing notation you wanted

97
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:37,830
.

98
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:43,570
And then off of that you can call plot area and you get a plot that looks like this.

99
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:49,890
And if you wanted it to Looks like the plot below you could actually put in an alpha value there.

100
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,960
All right there is a bonus challenge and note you may find this really hard reference's solutions you

101
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,200
can't figure it out but notice how appear the legend was actually overlapping some of the actual diagram

102
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,230
.

103
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,030
They usually wouldn't want that and I want you to figure out how you can display the legend outside

104
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:12,150
of the plot as shown below over here and again back on that theme of trying to discover things on your

105
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,860
own.

106
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,420
I want to for you to try google searching for a good stack overflow link and if you could find that

107
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,070
on your own there was a link to a stack overflow question.

108
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,020
So if we take a look at this link on stack overflow someone's asking how to put the legend outside the

109
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,350
plot with pandas and if we kind of scroll over here and take a look at this you'll notice that someone

110
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,930
actually answer this question correctly and they said right here that Piel t that legend location center

111
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,470
left and then this beby box to anchor.

112
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,700
That's the key here.

113
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:51,240
And you actually just copy this code and paste it here and then take the other code of this area plot

114
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,850
and paste it here and then when we want to do is create a figure

115
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,310
for these to be all called and then will say puberty that show.

116
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,180
And this will create a figure with the legend outside.

117
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:18,370
This would also work if you actually remove the first line and the last line in Jupiter notebook.

118
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:24,480
In other situations such as other ID errors you may have to actually find the figure and show the figure

119
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:24,690
.

120
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,920
But since we're just using Jupiter a notebook can actually just run these two lines and it will remove

121
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,480
the legend and place it on the outside.

122
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,850
So the basic idea here is hopefully you can discover on your own how to grab these sort of lines of

123
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,170
code and put them into your own code.

124
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,900
And that's actually a very common thing to do is check on Stack Overflow see what lines of code are

125
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,000
relevant to you and then fit them into your own work.

126
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,910
OK that's it.

127
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,430
Great job everyone and I will see you at the next lecture.

128
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,460
Feel free to post the Q&A forums if anything was confusing here for you.
