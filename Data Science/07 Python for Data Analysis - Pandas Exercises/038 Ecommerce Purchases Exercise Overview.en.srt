Hello everyone and welcome to the pandas exercise lecture covering the e-commerce purchased this exercise

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:11,910
.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,140
This lecture we're just going to get a brief overview of the questions and the e-commerce purchases

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:22,080
exercise as a quick note if you're looking for the files and notebook they're located under the Python

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,990
for data analysis folder underneath Pandurs and then pair exercises as a folder that contains both the

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,190
notebook the solutions notebook and the e-commerce data file itself.

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,680
The CSP file.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,790
All right let's go ahead and jump to the chip or notebook with the questions for this exercise.

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,950
All right here I am at the actual folder and those exercises are going to go ahead and click on e-commerce

10
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,100
purchases exercise and open up that notebook in a new tab.

11
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:49,540
OK.

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,590
And just a quick note there's also the e-commerce purchases here.

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,370
Note that it actually doesn't end with that cxxviii but it's still a CAC file.

14
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,710
Let's go check out our e-commerce purchases exercise and just go through it.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,220
So this exercise you're going to be given some fake data about some purchases done through Amazon where

16
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,700
you're going to go ahead and do just follow the directions and try your best to answer the questions

17
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:14,310
and the tasks as always feel free to reference the solutions and most of the tasks that to solved in

18
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,190
different ways.

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,910
So don't take the solution as the only way to solve it.

20
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,260
Also please excuse anything that actually makes sense as far as a real world data frame because all

21
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,880
of this data is just fake and made up.

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,150
So you'll see some credit card information that's all fake.

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,310
Don't worry about it.

24
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,260
OK.

25
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,200
What you're going in the doing.

26
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,890
It's just going along and following the instructions that are highlighted in bold.

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,800
You have some empty cells to work with.

28
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,650
And along these cells below them are actually some outputs of what you should expect.

29
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,180
OK so you just going to go along the questions get gradually harder and harder and then towards the

30
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,920
very end if you scroll down.

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,810
There are some labeled hard questions here.

32
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,210
And these are a little trickier.

33
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,680
They usually task you to use your own custom function in order to actually answer the question.

34
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,350
All right.

35
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,190
That's it for the e-commerce purchases exercise overview.

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,890
Coming up next.

37
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,430
Are the actual walk through for the solutions to this exercise.

38
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,460
Thanks everyone and I'll see a K'NEX lecture
