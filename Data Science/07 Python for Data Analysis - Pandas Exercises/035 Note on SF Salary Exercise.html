My solution is actually slightly off, I didn't take into account people that had punctuation in their title right next to the word chief, for example : Chief, Justice.Â </p><p>If you want to see a full discussion, search the qa forums for 'chief' , there are a lot of thread where students have posted alternative solutions that work correctly (there are a lot of ways to solve this one)</p><p>Thanks!<br></p><p>Jose</p></p>
