Hello everyone and welcome to the introduction to my lecture in this lecture we'll briefly discuss what

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,550
an umpire is and how to get it installed onto your computer.

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,080
None pi or none.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,020
Some people write or pronounce it as a linear algebra library for Python.

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,120
And the reason it's so important for data science with Python is that almost all of the other libraries

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,000
in the PI data ecosystem rely on PI as one of their main building blocks.

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,390
Plays incredibly fast and has bindings to C libraries and we going to learn how to work with higher

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,000
res as we continue on this section of the Course as far as getting them pie onto your computer.

9
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,350
It's highly recommended that you install Python using the Anaconda distribution to make sure all the

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,990
underlying dependencies such a certain linear algebra libraries all sync up with the use of a con to

11
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,340
install.

12
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,680
That means if you have Anaconda as your python distribution and you install Python onto your computer

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,710
using anaconda you can install them pie by just going to your terminal or to your command prompt and

14
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,630
typing Conda install NUMP pi.

15
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,210
Remember that's not it's a python that's just straight into your terminal or your command prompt.

16
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,520
If you do not have the Anaconda distribution you can also use Pippin's stall to install num pi.

17
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,390
Again the top conta install num pi is if you have the Anaconda's distribution and thus the recommended

18
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,640
method to install this library.

19
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,190
If you do not have the Anaconda distribution numpad can also be installed for Pipp install them.

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:35,940
All right.

21
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,970
Let's briefly discuss how we're going to use pi throughout the section of the course.

22
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,600
We're mainly going to be working with numb pire race throughout the course.

23
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,290
The empire is essentially come in two flavors either vectors or matrices.

24
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,220
Vectors are strictly one d arrays and matrices are two the two that missional.

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,830
We should also note that a matrix can still only have one row or one column.

26
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,270
OK we're going to talk a lot more about an umpire raise and show you how to work with them in python

27
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,490
in the next lecture for umpires.

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,530
So let's go ahead and get started with first if an umpire is in Python.

29
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,700
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
