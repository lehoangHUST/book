00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,690
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,990
Welcome to the PI exercises overview lecture.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,490
In this brief lecture we're going to quickly go over the exercise questions and how to approach them

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:14,830
.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,180
Then you'll go ahead and perform the exercises see if you can solve them.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,810
And after that we'll have a lecture on the solutions.

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,720
Let's go ahead and jump to the exercise notebook and quickly go over the questions.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,210
All right.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,510
Here we are at the PI exercises notebook which you're going to go ahead and do it.

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,720
Just answer the questions or follow the instructions in bold and you'll see that there's actually output

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,120
arrays for you or output answers for you which are the answers you should get.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,940
Keep in mind that if you actually run the cell that has the direct output below you will overwrite the

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,840
output.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,800
So for instance if you're saying create an array of 10 zeros hopefully you remember from the lectures

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,730
how to do that.

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:01,160
But if you have code here such as print hello and run that code you will no longer see this output.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,680
So keep that in mind as you're running through this exercises.

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,290
All right.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,760
So basically we'll start off with asking you how to create some arrays some array of integers some array

20
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:19,770
of identity matrices three by three Matrix etc. Some random number matrices and then I'll ask you to

21
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,470
create this following matrix.

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,620
So keep in mind that you should insert cells here in order to not delete the output.

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,340
Then I'll ask you to create an array of 20 line nearly spaced points between 0 1.

24
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,360
So just go ahead and follow the instructions here and pay careful attention to not overwrite the output

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:36,450
.

26
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,600
If you're not ready to overwrite it yet then we'll talk about pi indexing and selection where it I'll

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,520
give you a few matrices.

28
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,950
In this case it's just actually one matrix.

29
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,630
This one through 25.

30
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,600
That's a five by five matrix.

31
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:56,540
And I will ask you to grab chunks from that matrix and notice here I have given you an extra cells since

32
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,040
these are a little trickier and you need the reference.

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,040
So go ahead and write your code here and that reproduces the output in the cell below and be careful

34
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,260
not to actually write your code here.

35
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,570
Otherwise you'll overwrite the output that you're trying to replicate.

36
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,040
And if you get it wrong the first time you don't remember what you're actually trying to answer.

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,390
So again just write the code here in these cells.

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,100
That way you don't overwrite the output itself.

39
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,660
OK.

40
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,500
And then through those exercises you're going to be trying to grab the chunks shown here as the answers

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:25,880
.

42
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:32,180
Then in that same matrix or that reference that same matrix you'll get the sum of all the values get

43
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,720
the standard deviation of all the values and then get some the sum of all the columns in that matrix

44
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,320
.

45
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,970
All right.

46
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,880
That's it.

47
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,690
Best of luck.

48
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,770
And coming up next.

49
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,700
Are these solutions to these dumb pie exercises.

50
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,600
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture
